 skilled questions and techniques that  
 work with with human behavior that might  
 be important to use techniques that work  
 with human behavior rather than work  
 against it now that's called nepq it  
 stands for neural emotional persuasion  
 questions we're going to talk a little  
 bit about that today all right so that's  
 what I mean when I say nepq now we have  
 to teach you the right tone because  
 there's certain questions you have to  
 ask in your sales process that are more  
 of a curious tone where you're okay John  
 can you walk me through more of a  
 curious tone there's other questions you  
 have to ask in more of a  
 skeptical challenging tone and then  
 there's other questions you have to ask  
 and more of a  
 concern tone a tone that shows more  
 empathy well do you know which is which  
 and when and how to do that if you don't  
 that means you're losing sales that are  
 clients who sell exactly what you are  
 they make those every single day all  
 right now if you want to start learning  
 those same skills that our clients have  
 in your industry if you want to start  
 making your first 10 grand a month in  
 commissions with what you sell if you  
 want to start making your first 15 or 20  
 grand a month every single month in  
 Commissions in your industry let's say  
 you want to start making 25 or 30 or  
 maybe 40 or 50 000 a month in  
 commissions with what you sell or hire  
 because we have clients in your industry  
 that do that every single day I can  
 assure you we have almost 12 000  
 testimonials at this point in the last  
 two and a half years more than any other  
 company in our space especially in three  
 years that's almost impossible so if you  
 want to acquire those skills then  
 message me directly right now so if  
 you're on LinkedIn or the Facebook  
 groups or uh IG or Tick Tock message me  
 directly right now okay if you're on  
 YouTube you won't be able to message me

 what I want each of you to do real quick  
 before I give you these questions on the  
 board what's up Sam how's it going

 heart button and smash the like button

 smashed hearts and hundreds of smashed

 to 11 in apq clarifying questions I  
 won't even charge you for those in being  
 Mr Nice Guy here all right all right  
 let's go and smash that now uh what I'm  
 also going to do as well but you know  
 what let's just roll into it now if  
 you're on the live do this if you're on  
 the live post hashtag live so if you're  
 on the live post hashtag live Daniel hey  
 this is my first live nice to meet you  
 what's up Daniel so if you're on the  
 live post hashtag live and if you're on  
 the replay I want you to post hashtag  
 replay okay all right let's go ahead and  
 jump into what I'm going to cover today  
 because I know unfortunately none of you  
 care about me you just care about these  
 questions you just care about yourself  
 you guys are so selfish what are we  
 gonna do hey thank you for smashing that  
 I love that all right now let me I'm  
 going to give you some examples of what  
 are called any PQ clarifying questions  
 and these have to be asked after you ask  
 what are called expanded probing  
 questions okay now these are very  
 important to help get your prospect to  
 go below the surface with their answers  
 and tell you what's really going on how  
 do you do that okay so these clarifying  
 questions help you clarify what your  
 prospect is saying so you uncover what's  
 really going on what are the real  
 problems how are the you know what's the  
 root cause of the problem like what's  
 causing the problem and then how are  
 those problems actually affecting them  
 even personally okay they'll also help  
 you probe deeper to pull out your  
 customers emotions to get them into what  
 we call their emotional state which  
 triggers them to want to change their  
 situation because they feel  
 urgency from where they are compared to  
 where they want to be what's up Kayla  
 what's up Cody all right thanks for  
 being on here right so how do you do  
 that so I'm going to give you some very  
 these are very simple questions npq  
 clarifying but they're also very  
 powerful if you know how to use them and  
 where to use them in the right tone all  
 right so I'm going to show you up on  
 these on the board here and we're gonna  
 roll over here so blank let's put this  
 um IG phone maybe over here will you be  
 able to still see the video there where  
 we can it's the connected they should be  
 able to read there's a little bit of a  
 light there we can see that  
 I don't know if they can see that a  
 little bit better  
 maybe here  
 okay got it yeah  
 yeah well Tick Tock we're gonna have to  
 move that back a little bit because  
 Sarah okay they're just going to be back  
 here yeah looks a little bit crooked but  
 I don't know Tick Tock we're sorry if  
 you guys can you just cuss us out it's  
 okay we love you Tick Tock give them a  
 Snickers bar they get angry on Tick Tock  
 now the IG guys they're really nice  
 Facebook you guys are nice you know Tick  
 Tock big a little bit aggressive  
 sometimes okay  
 now  
 where's that light back there  
 okay hopefully we got rid of it all  
 right so hopefully you guys can see all  
 this I didn't have much time to prep I  
 just got back from the freaking airport  
 ran in here like a mad dog all right so  
 let's go over here so let's say the  
 prospect says something and it's a  
 simple clarifying question because you  
 have to clarify what they mean you have  
 to clarify what's behind the question so  
 if they say something this is a really  
 easy question to ask you that most  
 people don't even know how to ask it  
 John how do you mean exactly or John  
 when you say it's too expensive in what  
 way or Sally when you say blank how do  
 you mean by that Sally when you say  
 blank how did you mean by that just so I  
 understand  
 see that's a simple clarifying  
 question okay  
 the problem is is that most don't know  
 how to ask these simple questions so a  
 prospect asks them something or let's  
 say a prospect says something and they  
 just roll off the they just roll up  
 whatever is off their mind even though  
 it might not be the right answer for  
 that okay so you need to clarify why  
 they're asking how do you mean by that  
 exactly just so I understand or John  
 when you say blank how did you mean by  
 that just so I have a better background  
 or just so I have more context now I'm  
 also going to show you something here  
 this is called a probing  
 statement okay I know I wasn't even  
 going to talk about probes today but why  
 not I don't want to be selfish with you  
 guys all right so this is called a  
 probing statement so anytime a prospect  
 ever gives you a word that has to do  
 with uh any emotion okay so let me give  
 an example let's say your prospect says  
 they're stressed or somehow in that  
 conversation they say you know what this  
 has caused me to be frustrated or this  
 has caused some anxiety or this has  
 caused me to be worried or I I'm really  
 annoyed when my vendor says this or I  
 feel a lot of pressure from my boss or  
 you know I feel strained with work or  
 I'm just nervous all you simply do is  
 repeat back that one emotional word and  
 watch how they just spill their guts  
 okay so a prospect says you know you  
 know Blake I'm just I'm so stressed out  
 by this issue stress  
 or how do you mean by stress see how you  
 do that see how easy that is you can  
 quite literally just repeat back the  
 word frustrated  
 nervous  
 worried in what way concerned  
 see how I'm just repeating back the  
 emotional word and watch how they expand  
 on that answer so you have to get them  
 to expand on their answers so they can  
 relive their pain  
 if you can't get the prospect to relive  
 their pain they don't feel any urgency  
 to want to move away from that pain okay  
 so these are just simple exercises when  
 you say stress how did you mean by that  
 exactly or what do you mean by stress  
 John see how easy that is all right  
 let's keep going here because I've got a  
 training call right after this I gotta  
 fly through this folks all right  
 now here's an example so let's say in  
 that same scenario they say oh I'm just  
 feeling some stress with you know my  
 let's say you sell B2B and they're like  
 I'm just feeling so stressed out because  
 my department head says that we have to  
 you know Inc we have to we have to cut  
 our advertising costs by seven percent  
 in the next quarter just I'm just  
 randomly making something up and they're  
 like it's causing me to feel stressed  
 how do you mean by stress  
 ah okay and how long has that stress  
 been going on see this is more of a  
 probe here this is more of a probe okay  
 so at this point after we clarified we  
 probe off that okay and how long has  
 that been going on for oh the past three  
 years okay so you you've had that same  
 stress the last three years has that  
 has that had a  
 impact on you oh my gosh Jeremy you have  
 no idea well what way though  
 see how I'm doing that okay has that now  
 it's important here that you have a  
 verbal pause so when you probe first of  
 all you want to ask how long that's been  
 going on now why do you want to ask well  
 how long that's been going on  
 because then they tell themselves how  
 long they've had the problem then they  
 tell themselves how long they've had the  
 stress or the anxiety that builds more  
 of a gap from where they are we call  
 that their current state compared to  
 where they want to be we call that their  
 objective State what's the Gap all these  
 Newfound problems that your  
 questionability has allowed them to see  
 they have that they never knew they had  
 before they first started talking to you  
 this is really simple nibbles I'm giving  
 this is little stuff I'm giving you  
 folks this is easy basic stuff okay hold  
 on so how long is that stress been going  
 on for  
 over the past three years okay so having  
 that stress has that has that had a  
 impact on you notice that did you see  
 how my tone changed at the end so that's  
 stress you've had that stress the last  
 three years has that  
 has that had a  
 impact on you notice how my tone softens  
 it's more of a concern tone at that  
 point see how that works that triggers  
 the prospect to think deeper about the  
 question I just asked if you can't get  
 them to think deep about it they give  
 you a knee-jerk reaction they stay  
 surface level and that's why all of you  
 get I want to think it over I need to do  
 more research I need to keep looking  
 around I need to get more quotes because  
 you don't know how to bring them below  
 the surface yet now you can acquire  
 those skills make selling like 10 times  
 easier than it is for you now you make  
 10 times more money than you are now I  
 don't care if you're already doing good  
 we've taken people that make 250 000 a  
 year in commissions that now make six or  
 seven or eight hundred thousand a year  
 Market missions they thought they were  
 the god of sales but they just didn't  
 know how to take the prospect really  
 deep under the surface okay now once  
 they say oh my gosh you have no idea  
 well in what way though hold on in what  
 way say I'm doing that that concern tone  
 okay let's keep going all right  
 I'm going to give you some more  
 four more here be Mr Nice Guy we might  
 even have a couple more on the next page  
 all right let's keep looking at what we  
 got here okay  
 can I ask what's causing this issue  
 what's causing this to happen just so I  
 understand  
 what's prompting you to look into  
 changing this just so I have a better  
 background can I ask what originally LED  
 you to this decision in the first place  
 well what is this why is this so  
 important to you now though can I ask  
 why this is important to you now just so  
 I understand  
 why so important you now can I ask why  
 see these are easy clarifying questions  
 depending on what they say now obviously  
 if they say something there's going to  
 be we're not going to say what's causing  
 this to happen if that doesn't make  
 sense to ask that okay but if they have  
 like something that they said and you  
 want to bring out more pain hold on can  
 I ask I mean what's what's causing that  
 to happen  
 see my how my tone I'm concerned I'm  
 concerned for them you see how that  
 builds trust and Authority with your  
 prospect because they trust you if they  
 don't trust you they don't buy from you  
 okay trust means they trust that you can  
 get them the results they want all right  
 that's way different than if they like  
 you like and Trust are two different  
 things okay here's some more here's some  
 more okay can I ask why that's important  
 for you now or can I ask why or can you  
 be more specific when you said blank I  
 didn't understand John can you walk me  
 through I'm having a hard time  
 understanding that  
 Sally can you unpack that for me for a  
 bit or John can you unwrap that a little  
 bit I'm a little bit lost or can you  
 give me example of can you give me an  
 example of that so I have more context  
 so they tell you something like oh well  
 we don't like the company that we're  
 with when they do this and this can you  
 give me an example of that just so I  
 have more context see how you're  
 clarifying that you're clarifying to  
 find out what's behind that because if  
 you can't clarify to find out what's  
 behind that they stay surface love with  
 you they don't relive their pain pain is  
 good for you and the prospect you know  
 what I'm gonna give you some more  
 I said I was going to give you nine I've  
 already given you like nine or ten I'm  
 gonna give you like six or seven more  
 because why not Merry Christmas  
 okay here's more  
 John could you share with me what's  
 motivating your decision to and then you  
 repeat back whatever you whatever that  
 is okay what are you hoping to  
 accomplish by us possibly working  
 together  
 what would that do for you  
 personally  
 okay now look at this one  
 those dots right here okay dots mean  
 that's a verbal pause okay so you want  
 to have verbal pauses between some of  
 your questions all right because verbal  
 pauses trigger the prospect to like hang  
 on to what you're about to say it draws  
 them in okay uh if anybody's ever seen  
 like Tony Robbins speak like when he  
 gets off stage you'll notice he'll ask a  
 question and like halfway through that  
 question he pauses for about two seconds  
 and then he finishes the rest of the  
 question another really good politician  
 that was really good at that was  
 President Obama he was really good at  
 verbal pauses and I don't get into  
 politics guys I'm like an independent I  
 just kind of vote on whoever I think is  
 the best person I don't care about  
 politics I know some of you are going to  
 get angry and fight okay that's okay I  
 still love you love you Democrats love  
 you Republicans I'm just Mr independent  
 guy here all right so communication  
 Styles he was very good at verbal cues  
 and verbal pausing okay that triggered  
 the prospect to want to engage all right  
 what are you you hoping to accomplish by  
 us possibly working together now  
 possibly here is more of a neutral term  
 this is asked more early in the  
 conversation at the end of the  
 conversation when you're like  
 kind of committing them to take the next  
 step to close you're not gonna you don't  
 need to use the word possibly at them  
 this is more in the beginning phase okay  
 what were you hoping to accomplish by us  
 possibly working together okay that's a  
 neutral word it makes the question more  
 neutral where the prospect opens up  
 instead of shutting down well I didn't  
 say we were going to work with you when  
 I say possibly they can't say that  
 because I'm just being neutral I'm not  
 assuming there okay tell me what's  
 driving the need to change their what's  
 driving the need to change their  
 situation just so I understand or how  
 about this okay  
 um  
 let me ask you in this way I've got some  
 notes Here For You  
 okay uh okay I see tell me what's  
 driving the need to change your  
 situation now though why not push it  
 down the road can I ask what's driving  
 the need to change this XYZ just I mean  
 why not just push it down the road like  
 unsuccessful businesses would if you  
 sold B2B see how I'm just applying that  
 okay I'm gonna give you more being  
 really nice now I know I'm going to give  
 you like 20 today I already knew that  
 but I just thought I'd keep you on pins  
 and needles how about these here  
 um yeah let's see here what do we want  
 to do here can you walk me through the  
 steps that led to this conclusion to  
 bring us in can you walk me through the  
 steps that led your company to want to  
 bring us in what would it mean for you  
 to be able to solve that problem though  
 in what way okay what would that do for  
 you well how do you mean see how what  
 would that do for you what would that  
 mean for you okay so once we get them up  
 into their future State that's in more  
 of our solution awareness questions and  
 they say like oh my gosh like I would do  
 this I would do that you being able to  
 do those things what would that  
 what would that do for you what would  
 that mean for you see those are  
 clarifying questions okay notice my  
 tonality the I want to say soft but I  
 show more empathy there more concern at  
 the end of that okay here's here's  
 another one here  
 um  
 okay let's say you're selling B to B  
 okay this question I'm about to give you  
 if you sold B2B helps you find out  
 what's behind this person's why and what  
 it's going to do for them let's say that  
 they're the department head they don't  
 own the company so you have to find out  
 what's at stake for them okay so you  
 might ask this question so what's in it  
 for you to implement this for the  
 company though just so I understand but  
 what's in it for you to be able to  
 implement this for the company well I  
 mean if I implement this and it goes  
 well I can get a promotion see now  
 they're more on your site see how you're  
 getting them to pull you in okay if we  
 were able to solve this  
 what would that mean for you well how  
 would it make you feel though okay see  
 those are clarifying questions all right  
 now I'm going to give you one last  
 example on how to use this  
 make sure you write this down Okay so  
 let's say that you're in a conversation  
 and the prospect says you know we've  
 been trying to get we've been trying to  
 get both these projects off the ground  
 for months now let's say if you sold B2B  
 okay here's the keyword trying now why  
 is that what does that word say to you  
 so if you sold B2B and the prospect says  
 you know we've been trying to get both  
 these projects off the ground for months  
 now  
 well the word trying is the key word  
 there so you want to say  
 John hold on you mentioned you've been  
 trying  
 what hasn't worked so far  
 you see Trine is the key word that word  
 represents what human feelings of  
 frustration about not being able to  
 accomplish their goal or get the result  
 they want that is your golden  
 opportunity to do what to bring the  
 prospects problems to the surface of  
 their mind to have them relive the pain  
 of their feelings and then help them be  
 open to your Solution that's going to  
 solve that okay so anytime you hear  
 words like this  
 you have to clarify John hold on you  
 said you're you've been trying  
 how do you mean by trying or what did  
 you mean by the word trying or hold on  
 when you say when you say you've been  
 trying what didn't quite work for you  
 guys just so I understand okay Shrine is  
 the word see how that works okay  
 I'd give you more but I already gave you  
 like 19 or 20\. so that's all you get  
 today all right so we are going to be  
 going live tomorrow inside the Facebook  
 group I believe it's 6 PM Eastern I'll  
 be interviewing one of our clients every  
 week we interview a new client from a  
 new industry uh this client was already  
 doing well when he first started with  
 this I think he was making close to 200  
 000 a year he now makes well over half a  
 million dollars a year so we went from  
 close to being at 200 000 a year to now  
 making like 550 000 a year selling the  
 exact same thing

 tomorrow so if you want to be on that

 probably about a hundred and fifty  
 percent increase or something like that  
 which isn't you know we have some

 you  
 know my friends are in this network  
 marketing thing they all seem very  
 similar to me tell  
 me why should I join your company it's  
 the best company  
 ever why should I go with you I can  
 create generational wealth for you and  
 your  
 family why should I go with you why  
 shouldn't you okay I want you three to  
 come up on stage with me quick quick  
 quick quick let's go who's one of your  
 biggest competitors myself no no no  
 companies I love you but just who's your  
 you know you have competition it's okay  
 we can be real yeah we got competition  
 in the market uh you know Prim America  
 if I asked someone from Prim America the  
 same exact question and I said why  
 should I go with them what do you think  
 they might say I have no idea you really  
 thought about it nope what do you think  
 they would say you really thought about  
 it what do you think they would say they  
 probably pitch me on their philosophy  
 maybe that they're the best yeah who's a  
 competitor for you same  
 company if I ask somebody from there the  
 same exact question why should I go with  
 them what do you think they would say we  
 have better  
 products okay they  
 don't now if I ask them that question  
 what would they say about your  
 products they say they have better  
 products but okay if I ask one of your  
 competitors the same exact question why  
 should I go with them what do you think  
 they would say why are you going with  
 them if you really thought about would  
 they say something like maybe that they  
 help create generational wealth I don't  
 think so they wouldn't say that at all  
 wouldn't say they have the best all okay  
 so what I think I hear all of you saying  
 right  
 now is that in your prospect's mind you  
 all sound the what same you all sound  
 the same could that be a problem for  
 you okay all right love you guys go  
 ahead and sit down now be careful I  
 might bring you back up and I've been  
 known to bring a lot of people on stage  
 you might want to be ready even in the  
 back corner right over there yes I see  
 you with your hand okay okay you sit  
 down I'll bring you back up if I ask you  
 to describe the word sales or selling in  
 one word Sol what would that word be  
 solution what else what  
 relationships what  
 value closing what  
 else okay all right I I like it oh this  
 is an interesting  
 group yeah okay what if we I like  
 everything you just said what if we took  
 everything all of you just said and we  
 wrapped it into one little word and that  
 word was  
 change you see all selling is is change  
 that's it all all selling is about one  
 thing only and that has changed so  
 whether your prospects are wanting  
 something better or they're moving away  
 from pain it's all about change it's  
 about how good you are and getting your  
 prospects to view that in their mind  
 that by them changing their situation  
 that means purchasing what you were  
 offering that by them doing that that is  
 far less risky for them than them doing  
 nothing at all staying in the status quo  
 their problems stay the same and nothing  
 ever changes  
 in  
 reality which is more  
 risky now here's your problem though  
 human beans don't like change even  
 though we say we do and why do we not  
 like think about that for a second I  
 just said all selling is is change yet  
 human beings do not like change and why  
 do we not like change we especially do  
 not like it when it's initiated by some  
 pushy salesperson or Network marketer  
 that's ready to pitch their Solutions  
 too early in the conversation and  
 repeatedly human behavior shows that we  
 value something that is more familiar to  
 us even if we don't like it that much  
 job over something that is new something  
 that is unfamiliar to us something that  
 is foreign to us I'll give you an  
 example raise your hand if you ever have  
 a friend relative business associate and  
 they just complain all the time to you  
 about the relationship they're in  
 everybody's got that person right and  
 you always wonder they don't like the  
 relationship but why do they they stay  
 because they're human and they're afraid  
 of change see that's what you're going  
 up against in your prospects mind to  
 some degree with every single Prospect  
 you talk to now how do you help your  
 potential customers overcome the fear of  
 change it's quite easy Once you learn  
 how if you never learn how it's really  
 hard and you're going to unfortunately  
 have to play the numbers game I'd rather  
 play the skills game who wants to play  
 the skills game make a lot more money  
 you get to help a lot more people now  
 let's start here realize  
 this you're not  
 selling the thing I know you love to  
 sell the thing but you're not selling  
 the thing you're selling the results of  
 what that thing does on the life  
 insurance policy side General Life I any  
 of that final expense you're not selling  
 them a  
 policy you're selling them the results  
 of what the policy does when one spouse  
 dies and the rest of the family's  
 financially protected forever that's  
 what you're selling if you're selling  
 them on the business side you're not  
 selling them to get  
 rich you're selling them the results of  
 what the business does for them which  
 could be to make more money which could  
 be to have more time with their family  
 which could be to be their own boss  
 that's what you're selling the results  
 of what your things do not the things  
 itself you with me now here's the  
 question I have for you that you might  
 want to ask  
 yourself how are you going to have a  
 competitive advantage in  
 2024 and and Beyond lots of lots of  
 people sell life  
 insurance lots of companies say they're  
 the best oh I know lots of network  
 marketers say they have the best comp  
 plan best  
 products how many salesp people that you  
 talk to we have the 47th best cop plan  
 in the industry you ever talked to any  
 network marketers who said that probably  
 not see we all say they're the best so  
 how are we going to have a competitive  
 advantage over everybody else it's  
 simply this the ones who will own this  
 upcoming market for decades to come are  
 the ones who simply learn learn how to  
 best communicate with their prospects  
 it's that simple the ones who know what  
 to say and ask that causes their  
 prospects to want to engage to want to  
 open up rather than trying to get rid of  
 you so how are you going to have that  
 competitive Advantage the next three  
 things how are you going to get your  
 prospects to stand out in their mind you  
 stand out in their mind as The Trusted  
 Authority the expert the next three  
 things number one becoming a problem  
 finder and Problem Solver not a product  
 Pusher product pushing is only going to  
 get you in the numbers game could be  
 trouble for you number two asking the  
 right questions but at the right time in  
 the  
 conversation and especially with the  
 right tone write this down your tone is  
 see if I can pass this  
 mic your tone is how your  
 prospects interpret the intention behind  
 everything you say and ask that's how  
 they interpret why you're asking the  
 question in the first place are you 100%  
 sure the questions you're asking are the  
 right  
 ones are you 100% sure you know how to  
 use your tone to get your prospects to  
 let their guard  
 down and number three eliminating sales  
 resistance so your prospects emotionally  
 open up and tell you their real problems  
 now let's do this I'm going to tell you  
 a little bit of my background show you  
 how I got here because my background is  
 going to show  
 you where you can take your sales and  
 persuasion ability even if you're  
 already doing well to and build build  
 your business to a level you never  
 really thought you could ever achieve  
 even your Wild stream so I got started  
 in selling 23 years ago as a broke  
 burned out college and I got my first  
 job selling home security systems door  
 too raise your hand have you ever sold  
 door to door also I know who my people  
 are yes you know how it is they give you  
 a they give you a script right they give  
 you a couple books by the sales gurus  
 they basically drive  
 you come out here I love you guys they  
 drive you out in a van and they  
 basically like kick you out of the van  
 right you know what I mean and they're  
 like hey go make some sales it'll be  
 easy we'll pick you up after dark  
 everybody heard that and that's what I  
 thought you know and I look back to I  
 was the last one to be dropped off and I  
 looked back at my sales manager his name  
 was xan Anderson he had the curly you  
 know the curly blonde hair the the  
 surfer guys you know how they talk I I  
 don't have the best impression but he's  
 like yo Miner remember when you knock on  
 the door show them how excited you are  
 show them your enthusiasm show them that  
 you believe in the product and they're  
 going to believe in the product and  
 they're going to be excited I'm the that  
 makes complete sense if I show them I  
 believe in it if I show them how excited  
 I'm about it then somehow magically  
 they're going to be excited about it and  
 believe in it well what did I know so I  
 started knocking on the doors and I was  
 really excited and I started talking  
 about my features and my benefits and  
 have we had the best this and the number  
 one this and were they're number one in  
 the market and a tria rating with the  
 Better Business Bureau and from the very  
 first door I started getting all these  
 objections what they didn't tell me  
 about that we don't need it  
 it's too expensive I can't afford it we  
 don't have the budget we already talk  
 with somebody from your company I need  
 to talk to my spouse I need to do more  
 research I need to get more quotes I  
 need to think it over can you call me  
 back a week a month a year later raise  
 your hand if you ever get any of those  
 objections oh some of the people in the  
 back they don't get any you guys are so  
 good back there no objections objection  
 objection prevention and I finally after  
 about oh geez 7 eight weeks of just  
 non-stop rejection barely making any  
 sales I remember standing on the curb  
 one late Friday evening waiting to get  
 picked up I had worked 12 it's like 13  
 hours I was crazy if you sold door to  
 door your legs are like jell you know  
 what I mean you're walking around like  
 sweat rolling down your chest middle of  
 the summer humidity I had made zero  
 sales and worked almost 13 hours in fact  
 that entire week I'd made zero sales 60  
 plus hours and when you're door too how  
 big is your base salary oh zero you're  
 straight Commission so when you don't  
 make any sales you don't make any money  
 that could be a real big problem and I  
 remember standing there like oh I wasn't  
 a born salesperson like everybody else I  
 don't have the gift of the gab I don't  
 know how to do this you know maybe maybe  
 selling just wasn't for  
 me have you ever felt that way  
 yourself have you ever looked into your  
 bank account and you had more going out  
 than you had coming in well that's where  
 I was at and I had a my firstborn  
 daughter Cammy on the way what was I  
 going to do 22 years old so I'm like  
 \[ \_\_ \] excuse my French I got to learn  
 this it's going to be a  
 problem so I committed to myself that I  
 was going to have to learn how to do  
 this because I know you like me want to  
 provide a great livest Stu for your  
 family that's why you got into the  
 business that's why you're here would I  
 be right now here was my major dilemma  
 though at the same time this is all  
 going on I'm going to well let me let me  
 go back here so my manager picked me up  
 this is important my manager picked me  
 up xan Surfer guy he popped in a Tony  
 Robin CD 22 years ago they listen to  
 these round things called CDs it's crazy  
 I I like what do we and Tony said  
 something like this I might be  
 butchering it Tony forgive me Father for  
 I have Sinn but Tony  
 said you will  
 fail you will fail for the simple reason  
 you don't learn the right skills that  
 are necessary to see you will fail if  
 you don't learn the right skills now he  
 went on to say every indust industry  
 teaches  
 skills but he said there's a difference  
 in the skill level you can acquire that  
 some skills you can learn from certain  
 people that are far more successful will  
 make you far more successful now I never  
 really thought about that cuz I thought  
 selling was just selling everybody sold  
 the same way everybody got the same  
 result I didn't understand this I was 22  
 so I thought I was like a light bulb  
 moment that it was like it's like divine  
 intervention from the heavens above that  
 maybe just maybe what the company was  
 training me what I was learning from the  
 sales gurus maybe they just weren't the  
 right skills anymore maybe they were  
 just outdated maybe they just didn't  
 work as well now  
 same time here's the dma I'm in college  
 major in Behavioral Science human  
 psychology which is the study of the  
 brain and why human beings make  
 decisions how does someone why does say  
 somebody say no to something rather than  
 yes what is triggered in their brain  
 that caused them to say not interested  
 and they didn't even hear what triggered  
 that  
 result now my professors they were  
 saying that the most persuasive way to  
 communicate was over here all the gurus  
 for the most part and programs I was  
 going through they were saying it was  
 here we're talking exact opposite so I'm  
 like this doesn't make any sense what do  
 I need to do like how do I take what I'm  
 learning about the brain and how it  
 makes decisions and wrap that into a  
 sales process with the right questions  
 how do I learn how to use my body  
 language to cause the prospect to trust  
 me more how do I learn how to use my  
 tonality to get the prospect to  
 emotionally want to open  
 up so I started learning how to do this  
 I started learning how to work how to  
 use techniques that worked with human  
 behavior rather than against it and I  
 started noticing I was getting my  
 prospects to do all the work I was  
 getting my prospects to sell themselves  
 I was getting my prospects to overcome  
 their own concerns and I was getting  
 them to pull me in rather than pushing  
 and pressuring because who the hell  
 likes that you don't like it when people  
 do that to you do you think you they  
 like it when you do it to them and  
 overnight  
 selling became very very easy and  
 exceptionally profitable now why did I  
 just tell you my  
 story because none of you care about my  
 story you only care about whose story  
 your own you're a human being that's  
 pretty normal it's just Behavioral  
 Science 101 cuz I want you to imagine me  
 within four years of almost quitting  
 standing on their sweating to death no  
 sales didn't know what I was going to do  
 almost gave up 4 years later I was  
 making multiple seven figures a year in  
 commissions as a W2 rep I went on to do  
 that in three completely industry  
 different Industries after that in fact  
 you might not know but I did it in your  
 industry I was in your industry for four  
 years top 150 people in your industry in  
 the world out of 108 million  
 people who's number 45 in the  
 world $2.5 million a  
 year oh a guy named Jeremy Miner who  
 could that possibly be now how long do  
 you think it took me to get on that  
 list a year and a  
 half I had no experience in MLM I had no  
 downline of 300,000 people I was  
 dragging  
 over how did I do it that fast do you  
 want me to show you  
 today okay really easy Once you learn  
 how I always say network marketing is  
 the highest paid profession in the world  
 sales is the highest profession in the  
 world  
 if you acquire the right skills it can  
 also be the lowest paining hardest  
 profession in the world if you don't  
 acquire the right skills funny story see  
 that guy number  
 44 that guy's downline trying to recruit  
 me when I was looking to get MLM and he  
 brushed me off said that guy can't do  
 this he's just a sales guy do you know  
 what his income would have been had he  
 recruited me oh a lot more than that oh  
 you never judge a book by cover you got  
 to be careful now how do we do that  
 let's have some fun here's the thing  
 here's here's the thing I want you to  
 understand I wasn't  
 born out of my mother's  
 womb with Advanced questioning skills  
 raise your hand if you're born out of  
 your mother's womb with Advanced  
 questioning skills oh  
 nobody I wasn't born with Advanced  
 tonality skills raise your hand if  
 you're born with Advanced tonal skills  
 oh  
 nobody so are sales people born or  
 made I wasn't born with Advanced  
 objection handling and objection  
 prevention skills I had to acquire those  
 skills I had to learn those skills so if  
 a kid who grew up in the middle of  
 Missouri on a cattle ranch outside of a  
 town with less than 800 people can  
 acquire those skills what does it mean  
 for you  
 it means you can acquire the same skills  
 right you can even if you're already  
 doing good or decent you can make two 3  
 5 10 times the results you're getting  
 your business starting today right now  
 now how are we going to do that because  
 it's all talk until we what start  
 acquiring the right skills are you going  
 to master this in the next 43 minutes no  
 what's it saying you can't teach a kid  
 how to what ride a bike at a seminar but  
 do you want to start the path would it  
 be easier to start this path than going  
 through the numbers game who loves the  
 numbers who loves getting rejected all  
 day long oh I just love the rejection I  
 just love it I hate it I really hate it  
 I'm going to put on the face that I love  
 it let's be real nobody loves it all  
 right number one here's here we go  
 become a problem finder and Problem  
 Solver not a product Pusher  
 now raise your hand if the prospects you  
 talk to have problems and or emotional  
 needs right ra your hand if your  
 prospect you talk to have problems and  
 or emotional needs everybody better  
 raise your hand because there's never  
 been a product or service ever invented  
 in the history of the world that doesn't  
 solve those two things does a $500,000  
 Ferrari solve a problem not really  
 unless you're a race car driver does it  
 solve emotional needs higher status want  
 to prove to your classmates you've  
 arrived you're successful want to show  
 Daddy that said you couldn't do anything  
 that you've arrived you're you got  
 bullied the kid by kids in school you  
 show them you're successful see it  
 solves an emotional need you're industry  
 does  
 both now grab a p piece of paper I'm  
 going to give you 23 seconds you better  
 be quick and I want you to write down  
 because I'm going to come and ask some  
 of you the two biggest problems that  
 your solution solves two biggest  
 problems write it down but I'm going to  
 come around and ask some of you two  
 biggest problems that your solution  
 solves 20 seconds two biggest problems  
 that your solution solves  
 two biggest  
 problems somebody tell me the two  
 biggest problems you got real  
 quick okay those are  
 good you know when I got into this  
 industry I'm like this is the easiest  
 industry on planet Earth to sell in do  
 you know  
 why  
 because I said well I'm want to ask you  
 how many people do you know that want to  
 make more money and have more time with  
 their family oh everybody so when I  
 found that I'm like everybody's a  
 prospect there's 8 billion prospects  
 besides some of the maybe the bll  
 billionaires I've got 8 billion  
 prospects this is the easiest thing on  
 planet Earth I came from B2B Enterprise  
 sales I could only sell to like 5,000  
 companies now I have 8 billion this is  
 the easiest thing now look at the two  
 problems that you just wrote down just  
 look at  
 it raise your hand if your Sol solution  
 solves those two  
 problems everybody be better raising  
 their  
 hand okay so here's what I think I'm  
 hearing you say in your mind your  
 prospects have problems and your  
 solution solves those your prospects  
 have problems and your solution solves  
 us so why are most of them running the  
 other  
 way what's the missing  
 link what if I suggested to you that the  
 missing link  
 well actually you know what I'm going to  
 do this first I'm going to ask you a  
 really cheesy question that I already  
 know the answer for can I ask you a  
 Cheesy question I already know what  
 you're who wants to Triple the policies  
 you wrote this year from last year who  
 wants to Triple your recruiting or if  
 you just started you're like 10 okay so  
 everybody now keep Your Hand raised keep  
 your hand raised if you can triple your  
 working hours  
 \[Music\]  
 you can't trip you already work 8 to 10  
 to 12 hours a day what are you going to  
 do work 24 I'm Court worker 30 hours of  
 you  
 can't so what are you going to do hope  
 and pray it works  
 out so if you want to sell way more than  
 you are have higher closing percentages  
 help way more people you're going to  
 have to what acquire a much higher level  
 of sales ability than you currently  
 possess would you be right now let's go  
 and talk about how we can do that  
 because here's what I'm going to suggest  
 it's  
 not it has nothing to do with your  
 prospects or leads of why people don't  
 buy from you even though you might my  
 leads are broke my prospects are all  
 broke they just have fear damn prospects  
 oh oh well another no leads to a yes I'm  
 just going to burn through my list burn  
 relationships has nothing to do with  
 them it also has nothing to do with your  
 mindset  
 whether you Journal meditate doesn't  
 matter how many cold plunges you take  
 every day that will not help you some  
 more I can assure you when the prospect  
 says hello if you don't know what to say  
 and ask that caus them to let their  
 guard down there's no sale cold plunging  
 I love it for your personal not going to  
 help you sell more it's not that you  
 don't it's not that you're not don't do  
 enough personal development I love  
 personal development not going to help  
 you sell more I promise you and it's not  
 that you're not motivated enough you're  
 all here you're motivated and it's damn  
 well that you don't work hard enough  
 raise your hand if you work hard so if  
 it's none of those things what the hell  
 could it  
 be okay it's what we're saying it's what  
 we haven't learned how to ask it's what  
 we're not using with our tone that is  
 causing our prospects to emotionally  
 shut down stay surface level how many  
 times do you ask questions in your  
 prospects to give you vague generalized  
 surface level answers did they plan on  
 doing that before he started did they  
 have a plan to do that when you ask when  
 he asked me that question I'm going to  
 emotionally shut down and going I say  
 sure yeah I I I might be interested did  
 they plan that or was it a triggered  
 reaction based off what you just said to  
 them or how you said it oh let's start  
 thinking about these things because it  
 might help us now who in here likes to  
 read books I love reading books in fact  
 my very first sales seminar I went to  
 was in the after the summer of 2001 when  
 I got started in sales Brian Tracy  
 anybody know Brian Tracy really good  
 friend of mine I love Brian and Brian  
 said something that stuck in my mind  
 forever he said well you guys forgot to  
 give me 70 minutes only got 60 on  
 here he said use your vehicle as a  
 university on  
 Wills now from that day forward I  
 started reading or listening to Five  
 Books a month times 12 months a year  
 times the past 23 years on sales  
 persuasion and influence took about  
 48 different courses on the subject and  
 in every one of those it says three  
 things sales is a numbers game you  
 always hear that one ABC's of closing  
 and you have to be a problem solver but  
 as I thought about what problem solving  
 actually  
 meant if your prospects don't don't buy  
 from  
 you how the hell are you a problem  
 solver problem solving can't happen  
 before they buy how you going to if they  
 don't buy you're not a problem  
 solver it happens after they buy after  
 you solve the problem so if you want to  
 get a lot better at selling a lot better  
 at helping people start a business with  
 you you got to get much better at  
 problem finding now what does problem  
 finding mean problem finding realize  
 this and I think all of you know this  
 when you first start talking to your  
 prospects for the most part they don't  
 even really know they have a problem  
 would I be right or maybe they know they  
 have a problem but do they sit there  
 with an Excel spreadsheet on Sunday like  
 mapping out like how many weeks months  
 years that if they pass away how their  
 family is going to pay for everything  
 for the next like 30 years probably not  
 right they probably don't sit there and  
 do that so they might know they kind of  
 have a problem like I want to make more  
 money but they don't really know the  
 depth of that problem they don't really  
 understand the consequences of what  
 happens if they don't do anything about  
 solving the problem because if we can't  
 help them find more problems in their  
 minds are questioning and tonality  
 ability it's impossible for them to ever  
 feel the need to what  
 change and that's why you get what  
 objections and the more objections you  
 get the less likely they are to what  
 stop binding to the myth that the more  
 objections you get the more interested  
 they are how the hell does that make any  
 sense no the more OB sing about the lay  
 down says that gave you no objections  
 makes zero sense if I get more  
 objections I'm more what the more  
 objections they get the more uncertainty  
 they have in their mind caused by us now  
 how do we get better at problem finding  
 what are most Network marketers I love  
 you guys hey I come I know I know what's  
 going on here I've been I was in that  
 ball game for four and a half years  
 fulltime most Network marketers I hate  
 to say this I love you you're going to  
 get angry with  
 me most of most Network markers have  
 been trained to be this product pushers  
 talking about our features our benefits  
 the the great comp plans we have oh you  
 know there's this guy I got to have you  
 meet him there's a call tonight his  
 name's Matt suppo you he's a  
 multi-millionaire Uncle you've got to  
 come it's the greatest opportunity on  
 the  
 internet and then we start talking about  
 features and benefits how we have the  
 best this and the best that that is like  
 taking a bucket of mud and throwing it  
 up against the wall hoping and praying  
 that something you're going to say or  
 something your upline is going to say is  
 Magic going to cause the prospect to  
 want to buy I call that hopium it's a  
 drug that so many of you are still  
 taking I'm going to take the Opium drug  
 I hope that slide 12 is going to  
 magically cause them because of the  
 color schemes to buy that is a very hard  
 and unpredictable way to build your  
 business you don't want to do drugs if  
 you want to make a lot of money in this  
 industry don't do drugs all right let's  
 go to step number two we're going to  
 start learning some tactical stuff step  
 number two asking  
 the right  
 questions but at the right time in the  
 conversation now let's go back to where  
 I was at remember I was in college  
 studying Behavioral Science in human  
 psychology study of the brain how do  
 human beings make  
 decisions why do they say no instead of  
 saying yes why does that actually happen  
 now according to Behavioral Science  
 might want to write this down there are  
 three forms of persuasion  
 like I said write it down because once  
 you understand where you are right now  
 and your persuasion ability compared to  
 where you could be this will completely  
 change everything for you now the first  
 era of selling first mode I'm not going  
 to give you the scientific term for it  
 you get bored but if I said the words  
 Boiler Room selling what's the first  
 image that comes to your mind what's the  
 first image boil the room selling what  
 comes to your brain would it be  
 this would it be that hey I got a great  
 opportunity for it we talk about the  
 features and benefits and we push and we  
 press tell them why they need to go into  
 us but according to the data oh the  
 pesky data that is the least persuasive  
 way to sell hence sales is a numbers  
 game so when we attempt to dominate them  
 when we attempt to posture them when we  
 tell people things when we try to push  
 we try to pressure we try to manipulate  
 them we are the least persuasive it's  
 just like if you told your kid you  
 really really need to do something and  
 you push them pressure what do they do  
 back they push back it's the same  
 concept it's just the way our brains are  
 wired now I'm going to give you a few of  
 the least persuasive ways to sell now  
 don't don't start throwing stuff at me  
 I'm just don't shoot the messenger  
 presenting all been T got have a great  
 presentation 45 to 60 Minute slide decks  
 here's a picture of our corporate  
 headquarters look at those nice Windows  
 here's a picture of our Founders they  
 have the most Integrity everybody says  
 that here's our Customer Service Awards  
 here's our tripa A Better Business  
 girlre we have the best we this we have  
 the best which by the way like I said  
 doesn't every salesperson say they have  
 the best product or service how many  
 sales people how many people in your  
 industry come up to you like we have the  
 31st best Compensation Plan you know in  
 fact we've got the 75th best coverage  
 it's amazing see nobody does so just so  
 you know psychologically even if you  
 literally have the best your prospects  
 you start to lose trust especially when  
 you talk down about your competitors do  
 you know why because they are used to  
 every single salesperson literally it's  
 ever tried to sell them anything saying  
 what they're number one they have the  
 best they have all this so they start to  
 trust you less doesn't even matter if  
 you're the number one now you're not  
 going to come out and say we're the  
 worst I'll show you what to do here now  
 according to the data it's not very  
 persuasive if your presentation is more  
 than 10% of your entire conversations  
 and that's the problem we train 161  
 different Industries including yours and  
 in your industry that is up over 70% of  
 you talking and presenting we got to get  
 that down to 10% that's a whole another  
 training telling your story hate to tell  
 you this nobody cares about your story  
 when you're selling one to one whose  
 story do they care about their story I  
 can't believe it what about putting  
 sales pressure on them do you do that  
 see there's a massive difference in  
 getting your prospects to feel so much  
 internal tension from the way you use  
 your tone and the questions that I'm  
 going to start showing you here that  
 cause them to feel they have way bigger  
 problems than they originally thought  
 they had compared to putting external  
 sales pressure on them I'll show you  
 what I mean by that in a minute and the  
 big one oh you might get angry at me at  
 this one throw me off the stage Jeremy  
 what are you talking about you must have  
 you must have got all the good leads  
 Jeremy assuming the sale especially if  
 it's too early in the  
 conversation that is exactly why  
 probably most of the sales training you  
 might have been through most of the  
 sales trainers say what sales is a  
 numbers game would I be right basically  
 what they just told you is what I'm  
 training you doesn't really work that  
 well so unfortunately you're just going  
 to have to work harder you're just going  
 to have to call more leads you're just  
 going to have to get way more rejection  
 you're going to have to get thick skin  
 you're going to get more nose to lead to  
 the yes raise your hand if you really  
 would want to do that that sounds  
 exhausting oh my does anybody want to do  
 that let's be real that doesn't sound  
 very fun burning through your family and  
 friends good Lord when they have  
 problems that we can solve now what do  
 we do  
 instead cuz I know some of you you're  
 like I got to I'm going through my list  
 of a 100 I've been in your I I know  
 what's going on I know what you're doing  
 got my list I got to call C cousin vizzy  
 okay it's a numbers game I I got to get  
 more noes to say the yes I can do this  
 yes okay cousin vzy blah blah blah blah  
 blah we start talking about it talking  
 about it we get rejected by the 10th  
 relative we called here's what we're  
 doing oh my God I can't take the  
 rejection anymore oh network marketing  
 is a scam it's not real I'm going to  
 blame everybody but  
 myself doesn't have to be that way it  
 will only be a numbers game if you use  
 traditional selling skills that trigger  
 fight ORF flight mode in their mind now  
 let's keep going second eror of selling  
 consultative selling okay we are the  
 second most persuasive consultative  
 selling came out in the late 7s early  
 80s with Sandler Institute methodologies  
 books like spin selling Neil rackam  
 college professor never sold anything by  
 the way and they taught that you needed  
 to ask questions to find the needs of  
 the client but what's a potential  
 downfall when you only ask surface level  
 logical based questions what type of  
 answers are your prospects going to give  
 you surface level logical based answers  
 and to human beings Buy on emotion or  
 logic emotion you've all heard it brain  
 studies proved that so once again more  
 persuasive than you know telling your  
 story putting sales pressure on them but  
 you're still having to play the numbers  
 game because you're not bringing very  
 much emotion by asking surface level  
 questions you want me to show you a few  
 surface level  
 questions for your industry I we see a  
 lot of scripts that come through our  
 conference rooms A lot of them for your  
 industry how about some of  
 these well let's keep going  
 here how about this one okay you're in  
 the car you're in the  
 car Uncle Kirby starts Uncle Kirby  
 starts complaining he like man I hate my  
 job freaking boss won't even let me go  
 to the bathroom I freaking hate it oh  
 really what else don't you like about  
 your job I Hate Everything those damn  
 son of a right start to hear that oh  
 Uncle crazy enough if I could show you  
 the very best money-making opportunity  
 available today would you be interested  
 and your uncle goes well well what is it  
 and then you start to do what oh it's  
 amazing we have so many people making so  
 much money I it's crazy in fact there's  
 this guy named Matt Sao he's made him a  
 multi-millionaire in fact we have a call  
 tonight he's going to go over how the  
 business works and how you can get rich  
 to will you commit to coming to the call  
 tonight so you can get rid of your job  
 and make a lot of money your uncle says  
 well how much does it cost it cost and  
 you tell them the cost whatever that is  
 and then they say I can't afford that  
 are you kidding me is this one of those  
 MLM schemes you know I did that 15 years  
 ago when it was a freaking  
 scam sound familiar  
 okay now did your uncle have  
 problems would your solution solve  
 those what was the missing  
 link us not Uncle  
 Kirby us why is it  
 us  
 because because you haven't learned yet  
 yet  
 how to communicate the right way  
 unfortunately for your uncle his problem  
 stay the same he's going to have to stay  
 in status quo and nothing will ever  
 change for him you see when I was in  
 your industry I wasn't willing to let my  
 prospects stay in the status  
 quo so the question is are you willing  
 to keep doing that to  
 yours do you want to change that yes  
 okay let's start learning how to do this  
 okay error number three we are the most  
 persuasive according to the data when we  
 get others to persuade themselves when  
 we ask what are called neuro emotional  
 persuasion  
 questions now you're asking well Jeremy  
 sounds really good how do I get Uncle  
 Kirby to persuade  
 himself that's the trillion dollar  
 question how much more where would you  
 be at in your business if you start to  
 acquire that  
 skill feel it think about about it now  
 here are the five stages of neq once  
 again this stands for neuro emotional  
 persuasion questioning think you guys  
 only put 60 minutes on the clock I was  
 told 70 so I'm going to go a little bit  
 longer all right well you  
 know now I don't have time I don't have  
 time to go through all the questions  
 friend you're going to need as Matt said  
 he's kicking me off at an hour and 10  
 minutes in he said do not go over I'm  
 throwing you off the stage now train a  
 lot of people in your industry the  
 insurance life insurance General Life  
 mortgage protection IL that's the second  
 largest industry trained in the world we  
 train tens of thousands in your space  
 Network Market is in the top 25 or 30  
 and I sold it I know a little bit about  
 this could be fun okay so let's start  
 here how do you get your how how do how  
 do how do how does society how does  
 society View salese and network  
 marketers in  
 general lower status would we be right  
 even if you're making a lot of money  
 lower status so how do you get them to  
 view you at a high status within the  
 first few seconds of any conversation  
 okay now should I show you before I show  
 you some of these industry specific nbq  
 questions should I show you some  
 predictable statements and questions  
 that most people in your industry are  
 still using unbeknown to you that are  
 lowering your status on a daily basis  
 are you sure you really want me to show  
 these to you because here's so hold on  
 hold here's my concern  
 I'm  
 concerned that if I show you I mean  
 there are hundreds of them if I only  
 showed you a few of them that your next  
 Prospect you talk to it's going to  
 mentally you're like oh \[ \_\_ \] I just  
 lowered my status I don't know what to  
 do next you sure you want me to show  
 because you got we got two choices here  
 now in Behavioral Science this is called  
 social dynamics raising your status we  
 have two  
 choices I always give everybody two  
 choices you we can keep taking the blue  
 pill numbers game work harder get more  
 NOS to get the yes go through the list  
 of hundreds hope it works  
 out or we can play the skills  
 game top athletes top 1% athletes top 1%  
 business owners top 1% Network marketers  
 they play the skills game Steph Curry in  
 the NBA does he play the numbers game or  
 Skills game oh skills oh oh don't worry  
 coach it's just a numbers game just  
 shoot it as many times eventually you  
 hit one he wouldn't have made the JB  
 team no Steph knows it's a Skills game  
 that's why every day you see him what  
 working on his technique his El his  
 wrist his elbow movements how he's  
 moving he knows to stay on top he has to  
 focus on the skills game so which path  
 do you want to go down skill skills G  
 okay it's it's usually a lot more  
 profitable a lot more fun okay let's go  
 now let's say you're now when I do this  
 I'm going to show you I want you to pay  
 attention to my tonality and I want you  
 to pay attention to my facial  
 expressions your facial expressions are  
 the remote control to your your  
 tone because some questions are going to  
 require more of a curious tone there's  
 other questions that going to require  
 more of a confused tone there's other  
 questions going to require more of a  
 challenging tone there's other questions  
 where you've got to lean in and have  
 more of a concern tone a tone that shows  
 more empathy and then there's other  
 questions where you got have more of a  
 playful tone uh just hanging out being  
 the boring guy what about you you being  
 boring that's a playful tone your tone  
 is how they interpret  
 the intention behind everything you say  
 and ask now I'm going to give you an  
 example of NQ questions this is where  
 you take the focus off you put it on  
 them immediately raises your status get  
 them into results based thinking over  
 price or cost based thinking now here's  
 the numbers game strategy the most in  
 network marketing oh my God I don't want  
 you to play this game how about this oh  
 yeah I've got a somebody let's say  
 somebody comes up to you at an event not  
 this event just at any normal event  
 what's one of the first questions ask  
 you what do you do for work what do you  
 do for  
 living and you say oh I got a business  
 where I help people print  
 cash who's guilty or your card says that  
 business to print cash I know some of  
 you are guilty what about this one I've  
 got a business where I help people fire  
 their boss and live the life of their  
 dreams oh some of you got that one you  
 know what most of your prospects are  
 thinking in their mind this salesperson  
 salesperson mlmr run  
 that's what they're thinking when we say  
 things like that even though we think  
 it's helping it's lowering our status so  
 how do you raise your status you want me  
 to show you how we train people in your  
 space how I raise my status in your  
 space to get to that level within a year  
 and a half okay let's say I'm at that  
 same  
 event okay I'm going to show you a few  
 things I'm just going to put it up here  
 somebody  
 here I'm going to come role play with  
 you  
 you want to role play okay let's do it I  
 like to have  
 fun okay uh is somebody part-time in  
 this business raise your hand part time  
 okay what do you um just here's can I  
 can I ask a favor for this to work I  
 need you to go back to what you used to  
 do for a living okay I want you to think  
 that way I don't want you don't know  
 anything about network marketing you  
 know anything about this amazing group  
 in here you don't know anything okay  
 just tell me what you what you used to  
 do before we role play what are you do  
 now uh I'm a nurse manager nurse manager  
 okay let's see if I can screen okay um  
 ask uh hey will you come up here and  
 stand with me sure give her a round of  
 applause how about right  
 here now okay you come you come closer  
 it's okay I'm it's okay this is a safe  
 place okay okay um I got I got to look  
 here I I don't have all this memorize  
 okay why don't you let's write event you  
 ask me what I do for a living go ahead  
 so what is it that you do for a living  
 oh geez you'd probably you'd probably  
 get bored if I told you I'm sure what  
 you do is way more interesting are you  
 an underwater basket weaving what do you  
 do I'm a nurse manager  
 stop why would I just downplay what I  
 did oh geez you'd probably get bored I'm  
 sure what you do is way more interesting  
 what do you do she says a nurse okay uh  
 look look at the screen there you just  
 kind of role play with me there can you  
 see that Prospect okay just you know but  
 be real you can make it your own okay go  
 ahead oh haha  
 so okay okay okay you don't have to say  
 haha okay go  
 manager I'm sure what you do is not  
 boring but what is it that you do okay  
 if if I tell you will you will you not  
 tell anybody because when I tell people  
 they like start chasing me down like  
 always wanting to do this and I don't  
 have a lot of time what I do is you know  
 you know how a lot of people get  
 frustrated by you know working for  
 somebody else like can I go to the  
 bathroom you know or they're just  
 concerned about how they the hell  
 they're going to pay for everything with  
 all the inflation going on and sometimes  
 they just get pissed at their boss for  
 like not promoting them you know what I  
 mean so what I do is I I help people  
 like that that are in that situation um  
 start like a sometimes part-time  
 sometimes full-time business so they can  
 uh start making uh more money but like  
 like I said just a bunch of boring stuff  
 now what do you think she's going to  
 do oh that sounds really boring I'm not  
 going to ask you what it  
 is now what am I just doing what am I  
 what am I doing there  
 why would I downplay something in social  
 dynamics this is called mismatching when  
 you downplay in a sales situation not  
 all the way negative but when you  
 downplay your prospects will actually up  
 playay it when you upay it they will  
 downplay it oh I'm I have a business  
 where I print  
 cash oh really you print cash what see I  
 want to D oh you'd probably get bored if  
 I told you I'm sure what you do is more  
 are you an underwater basket where even  
 what's going on playful tone what type  
 of tone I have playful tone my tone is  
 how the prospect interprets the  
 intention behind what I say okay see  
 that makes sense okay stay here I'm  
 going to get back up here and we're  
 going to keep going you you good you're  
 getting pretty good at acting I like it  
 all right now on the flip side what if I  
 did  
 this you ever heard this here's the  
 numbers game strategy you know our same  
 250k policy on the ins side it's 15%  
 cheaper than what you have and most  
 prospects do  
 this well I mean I'm only paying $80 a  
 month and that's only like $10 that I'm  
 Sav it's not even worth switching see  
 when I up playay they downplay now I'd  
 rather downplay it I  
 mean what's your name your your Tag's  
 backwards I'm just trying to help you  
 okay Tiffany I mean Tiffany you're only  
 going to save like 14 or 15% for the  
 same coverage I mean for someone with  
 your income it's not even a big deal  
 you're only going to save 12 13 14 bucks  
 a month I mean that's only like 150  
 bucks a year you're going to  
 save what do you think they're going to  
 do yeah that sucks most of the time they  
 say stuff when I would say that you know  
 they do man are you kidding me my mom  
 said every penny I save is a penny  
 earned or I could take my wife out to a  
 nice dinner with that when I downplay  
 they up playay are you with me on that  
 now I do not want to get a call tomorrow  
 like Jeremy I downplayed it and I found  
 out like do not buy this this is the  
 worst policy ever I do not mean downplay  
 it like  
 that we have i' I've got we have to  
 learn a little bit better how to do that  
 okay you with me all right let's keep  
 going situation questions help the  
 prospect understand what the you know  
 you want to just come up here with  
 me  
 \[Applause\]  
 oh all right I know you're freaking out  
 in the back don't worry I have insurance  
 okay situation  
 questions help the prospect find out  
 what the real situation is most of your  
 prospects don't know when you first  
 start talking to them how do you build a  
 gap to where they want to be if they  
 don't even know where the hell they're  
 at you can't I have to help her  
 understand what her real situation is so  
 let's say you know what this is crazy I  
 must be a hypnotist  
 because oh I said an RN oh yeah I you're  
 mind Powers I don't know what's going on  
 okay okay so let's let's get back into  
 let's say I posted something a a  
 Facebook post about a business I have  
 and you DM me like hey I might be  
 interested in that every once in a while  
 you get that let's say we meet on Zoom  
 okay so we're going to start in situ so  
 what do you do for a living what do you  
 do for work uh I'm a nurse manager and  
 how how long have you been a nurse  
 manager uh about 13 years hey and  
 forgive me I didn't even ask you are you  
 on your own or do you have a like a  
 family you're taking care of I have a  
 son ah okay okay now what did I just  
 found  
 out she got a son she's a nurse manager  
 that helps me kind of understand  
 generalize what her household income is  
 that's why I'm finding out now if I  
 would have asked her are you on now did  
 you see what I did cuz sometimes you're  
 like oh and uh what does your spouse do  
 for a living well why do you need to  
 know  
 that now watch this oh forgive me I  
 didn't even ask you are you on your own  
 or do you have a family you're taking  
 care of you will never get that oh well  
 they forgive me I didn't even ask you my  
 fault see what I'm doing there see the  
 nuances okay they'll always open up  
 because let's say I found out she was in  
 college student still living with her  
 mom and didn't work I might need to  
 financially qualify her to see if I can  
 even help her so I don't waste time see  
 what I'm doing there now if she told me  
 she was married oh what is your spouse  
 to for living oh he's a and she tells me  
 he's whatever now I know there's what  
 two household incomes and I kind of know  
 ballpark what they're making now see how  
 I'm I'm getting the whole picture and  
 I'm helping her get the picture as well  
 and I said well how long have you been  
 doing that type of work now she's like  
 25 years okay so just a rookie then oh  
 see what I'm doing there okay let's keep  
 going you ready you're good okay problem  
 awareness questions how do we get them  
 to build a gap from where they are to  
 where they want to be how do we get them  
 to find problems they didn't really know  
 that they had now I'm going to show you  
 a few different examples  
 okay so I mean you've been a been a  
 nurse for seven years I mean that's a  
 it's a fairly decent job I mean what's  
 caused you to feel like you might want  
 to start your own  
 business well I recently got a promotion  
 and I just realized that's kind of  
 that's it for me how do you mean well  
 how how do you mean you realize it's why  
 do you feel like it's that's it for you  
 well unless I continue to climb the  
 corporate ladder which is not what I  
 what do they promote you to what do they  
 nurse manager oh nurse so what's above  
 that Regional nurse manager why wouldn't  
 you want to do that though that's taking  
 me away from the the patient care that I  
 known to Love In what  
 way uh that would put me behind a desk  
 and just more at a manager role not  
 really taking care of patients anymore  
 ah I see and what about your so when  
 you're at work where's your son at uh  
 he's at daycare daycare and how many  
 hours do you typically work about 8 to 9  
 oh 8 to 9 n okay what did I just found  
 out do that seem conversational I know  
 we're role playing it's a little was  
 that conversational do you know why  
 because they use what are called verbal  
 cues to bridge from question to question  
 ah and how how long has your son been  
 there oh okay and then what do you do  
 see how I'm bridging from question to  
 question you're not going to sit back in  
 two seconds  
 pause okay cool awesome um let me ask  
 you scripted right see what we're doing  
 now so let's keep going here why why  
 would I say I do have 17 minutes left  
 not 7 minutes why would I say that's a  
 that's a fairly decent job what did I  
 just SE in her mind it's a fairly decent  
 job why not say that's an amazing job or  
 that job sucks nurses don't get paid  
 anything no actually they pay me a  
 lot it's a fairly decent career what did  
 I just seed with my  
 tone doubt you see how my tone influen  
 inuences her that's a fairly decent job  
 I mean what's caused you to feel like  
 you might want to start your own  
 business and now she tells who why she  
 wants to start her own business  
 herself is it more persuasive if she  
 tells herself or if I tell her why she  
 should do it oh it's about a 100 times  
 more persuasive you see where we're  
 going here you me to show a few more  
 examples okay here's another example I  
 mean so you've now I wouldn't ask both  
 of these questions I I would just use  
 different ones so I mean you've been a  
 nurse the last seven years do you 100%  
 like what you're doing for a living I  
 mean I definitely love being a nurse  
 what what do you like I love being able  
 to um disc Comfort people in the worst  
 diagnosis they can ever imagine in the  
 oncology World sounds like things are  
 100% perfect for you I wouldn't say 100%  
 perfect not 100% no what do you mean  
 well they just need to put more and more  
 on our workload but not really increase  
 our our pay what do you mean by more and  
 more just more  
 responsibilities and not increased to  
 pay what are they paying you  
 now well just ballp part what do they  
 pay you sure I get a salary of about 125  
 a year uh what are you what are you  
 actually really wanting to make though  
 if you could um well I want to be a  
 millionaire millionaire that means  
 different things I mean okay now stop  
 let's because we're going a little bit  
 far I want I want to say this what what  
 did I just do here now see the first  
 time I said so you've been a nurse the  
 last seven years do you  
 100% like what you're doing for a living  
 nine nine out of 10 people say well not  
 100% they say well I mean I like it but  
 not 100% not  
 100% now she didn't go for it she's one  
 out of 10 but did you see how I looped  
 back around and I said it sounds like  
 things are 100% perfect why wouldn't see  
 how I'm pushing her away so she does  
 what  
 comes pulls me back in yeah not 100% see  
 what I did yeah good okay now if I  
 didn't say 100% do you like what you're  
 doing for living yeah I like  
 it the word 100 I don't know that's word  
 100% sounds like things are 100% perfect  
 well I wouldn't say not 100% see how I'm  
 probing there see how I'm getting her to  
 what let her guard down and start to  
 emotionally tell me why she wants to  
 what change now there's a lot more to  
 this I'm just showing you a few examples  
 okay let me show you a few more examples  
 okay let's go here let's say I'm on the  
 insurance side I got to get a drink of  
 water  
 here so let's say if five insurance I  
 find out you have 100K work policy what  
 objection could I possibly get at the  
 end that they're just going to use that  
 why do they need me so I need to prevent  
 the objection from happening in their  
 mind right that's called objection  
 prevention why do you want to handle  
 objections when you can learn how to  
 prevent most of them well it's a lot  
 more funner so I mean you you've got  
 this 100K work policy I mean what's  
 caused you to feel like that's not going  
 to be enough for your son when you  
 pass well I saw on a social media post  
 that it doesn't follow me when I don't  
 no longer work that  
 job see how I'm starting to get her to  
 tell herself why that's not going to be  
 enough  
 would that be maybe important to you or  
 I could even say so you got the 100K  
 work policy are you wed to financially  
 protect that policy when you pass so it  
 it helps your son in retirement or what  
 are you wanting to do with that yeah I  
 definitely want something that's going  
 to protect my son now we're getting a  
 policy to protect the 100K work policy  
 that does what oh you you get a bigger  
 policy does it help them more yes see  
 how I position that so are you wanting  
 to like financially protect the 100K  
 policy for let's say you're married for  
 Jim  
 when when he retires or what do you want  
 to do that yeah if I could protect that  
 see now that objection is goodbye for  
 the most part see what I'm doing here  
 now we do this this this is called an  
 npq identi frame I mean you know good  
 for you we see that a lot I mean they're  
 lucky to your son's lucky to have a a  
 mother like you that's you know selfless  
 enough to take that burden off them I  
 mean so they don't have to go through  
 all that stress you know trying to  
 figure things out when you when you pass  
 unexpectedly I mean I uh  
 talk to a lot of people you know and  
 some people they just they don't really  
 mind putting that stress and and burden  
 on their kids that they leave behind you  
 know what I  
 mean yeah can I ask how come this is so  
 important to you protecting my son yeah  
 why is so important to you now though um  
 I would say the patients that I take  
 care of I I see young you know parents  
 leaving their their young children  
 behind and and I just don't want be one  
 of those I mean what happens what  
 happens if he if it happened to  
 him we do I just want to be able to know  
 that if something ever happens to me  
 that he's taken care of that's important  
 to you at least financially did anybody  
 notice anything I just  
 did why did I  
 emphasize this is the any frame see how  
 I said I talked to a lot of people and  
 you know now let's say if I did it this  
 way we do see that a lot they're lucky  
 to have a mother like you that's  
 selfless enough to take that burden off  
 them so they don't have to go through  
 all that stress trying to figure out how  
 to pay for everything I talk to a lot of  
 people you know and some people they  
 really don't mind putting the stress and  
 burden on their kids they leave behind  
 you know what I mean yeah  
 sure when you ask questions too fast you  
 give your prospects no time to  
 internalize what you're asking that is  
 the number one reason they give you  
 vague generalized surface level answers  
 because you're not pacing out the  
 question that's called verbal pacing now  
 did you notice what I did here can I ask  
 how come this is so important important  
 to you why would I emphasize this what  
 did I just cause her mind to  
 do now she thinks this policy and she  
 just told me and her why this policy is  
 so important to you and then I loop back  
 around so why so important to you now  
 though and now her mind went where why  
 it's important now this  
 time you see what see what we're doing  
 this is the skills game not the numbers  
 game yeah you okay with that okay let's  
 keep going here they're about to kick  
 off solution awareness questions let's  
 go so what what do you let's there's  
 other questions you got to ask don't  
 just ask five these like Jeremy I  
 haven't I didn't become a millionaire  
 Tomorrow there's other questions you're  
 going to have to learn besides these I'm  
 just giving you samples so uh what do  
 you really want to make in a in a  
 business of your own like what would be  
 like your let's say like your ideal  
 income annually what would you really  
 want to make don't say a million dollars  
 okay I won't okay uh say a million  
 dollar a million dollar  
 well you know not the first year let's  
 be a little bit more risk down the road  
 what do you really want to make your  
 first year uh about 2 250k 2250 okay so  
 with what you do now like with all your  
 incomes combined how how close are you  
 to 250,000 every single year uh so I'm  
 at 125 okay about halfway there so so if  
 you stay in in that job just be  
 completely real with me but  
 realistically how many years would it  
 take you before you yourself were making  
 you know  
 250,000 every single year just just  
 yourself in my current job yeah I would  
 never make that why I would have to  
 continue to promote and promote okay so  
 let's say that we come in we teach you  
 the business we help you get up to that  
 level I mean because you're talking  
 about doubling your income what would  
 you do with the money coming in the if I  
 doubled yeah where would you do put my  
 son in private school would you where I  
 a private Nanny where would you put him  
 at um I would put him at Legacy  
 Christian why that one uh one it's  
 really close to my house but two they  
 have a good reputation Christian curric  
 what else would you do beside School uh  
 you can be real with me what would you  
 really do this is off the Record what  
 would you really do I'm a single mom I  
 would get a fulltime living Nanny  
 yes so being able to to do that what  
 would what would that do for you  
 personally um it would one it would take  
 some work off my shoulders but also  
 bring me peace of mind that I have  
 someone that he trusts in what way in  
 what way Peace of Mind in what way um  
 just knowing that I have someone  
 trustworthy that you know that that  
 loved my son and um yeah so so time to  
 make a change possible yeah  
 okay what did I just  
 do who's who's selling  
 themselves who's facilitating  
 that do you want to learn the skills  
 game or stay in the numbers game see the  
 difference this is just a role play  
 you're in a role play you wouldn't even  
 know what's going on right you would you  
 see what we're doing here okay let's  
 keep going I'm going to show you a few  
 more examples Okay who in  
 here has ever got this an email or call  
 we really like what you and and what you  
 had to say we really liked you but we  
 decided just now's not a good time to  
 start a business but hey we'll get back  
 to you we're ready keep in touch anybody  
 get that one what what are you going to  
 do you going to argue with them oh the  
 reason why you should do this now is  
 because of BL blah blah blah blah and  
 how many of those people end up  
 starting Numbers Game 1 out of 50 that's  
 why you keep doing it get that a Foria  
 oh yes it works I'm 1 for 75 no let's be  
 8 for 10 9 for 10 I I mean they have  
 problems who who why are you why are you  
 qualifying to the prospects who has the  
 problems they do who has a solution you  
 do you're going to learn how to get them  
 to qualify to you cuz you're not the one  
 that has the problems so why are you  
 qualifying to them so I'm going to loop  
 back around I'm going to call you or  
 let's say we're here at lunch yeah yeah  
 that's not a problem can I  
 um can I can I ask you something sure  
 how um how can I communicate to  
 you that you might be making a  
 mistake without you getting upset with  
 me what type of tone did I just use  
 concerned Why let me do it like this way  
 can let me ask you something how can I  
 communicate to you that you are making a  
 massive mistake with like you're just  
 making a big mistake Cindy over how can  
 I communicate to you that you you might  
 be making a  
 mistake without you getting upset with  
 me no one will ever say you cannot  
 communicate that I might be making a  
 mistake they'll be like yeah sure what  
 do you have in mind well I'm just I'm  
 concerned that I mean what if you don't  
 do anything about this and you stay in  
 the same job the same income away from  
 your son another 5 10 15 years I  
 mean what  
 happens well I guess I I don't make a  
 change soon I'm not going to hit those  
 goals do you do you want to have to go  
 through that if you if you didn't have  
 to no okay I mean you from the  
 conversation you certainly sound MO at  
 but I mean for you why why do this now  
 like why not push it down the road like  
 unsuccessful people do I just don't have  
 \[Music\]  
 time numbers game Skills game which  
 one's going to get you there 10 time 100  
 times quicker see what we're doing here  
 okay no insurance do you want me to I've  
 only got like I thought I had 5 minutes  
 it says 30 seconds what should I do okay  
 all right okay so so what if I mean what  
 if you don't what if you don't do  
 anything about this and you end up  
 passing away years before you thought  
 you would I mean how  
 would pretend you're married how would  
 Jim end up paying for the house and all  
 the expenses at that  
 point I don't know well I mean do you do  
 you want him to have to go through that  
 if you didn't have  
 to okay okay all right I love you guys

\# How To Create MASSIVE Urgency in Sales (Full Masterclass)  
\# https://www.youtube.com/watch/q5P4Za63Tlk

 how many prospects do you feel you lose  
 every single week every single month  
 because you just have a hard time really  
 building urgency in the sale and they  
 just keep procrastinating well if that's  
 you come over the vibe board and what  
 I'm going to do is I'm going to show you  
 five what are called inq consequence  
 questions and then how to use them I'm  
 going to show you some generic versions  
 and then I'm going to show you some  
 industry specific versions so you can  
 tie in your industry to build far more  
 urgency than what you know how to do now  
 so you can more you can close more come  
 to the vibe board I'm going to show you  
 how this works all right so these are  
 called neq consequence questions and  
 they do three main things first of all  
 they see doubt okay so we have to see  
 doubt so they see doubt that they might  
 be making a mistake without the prospect  
 getting defensive because how many times  
 do you tell the prospect they're making  
 a mistake by not going with you or uh  
 they're making a mistake because they're  
 choosing this product or service over a  
 more expensive one that you have and  
 then the prospect gets defensive and  
 their guard goes up a lot of that so I'm  
 going to show you how to use any PQ  
 consequence questions where the prospect  
 feels that you're concerned for them and  
 they don't get defensive that's a big  
 difference now the second thing that npq  
 consequence questions do is most  
 importantly they get the prospect to  
 defend themselves let me repeat that  
 defend themselves on why they feel they  
 need to change their situation  
 now if you're a salesperson is it good  
 for you to get the prospect to defend  
 themselves on why they need what you're  
 selling probably yeah for sure now I  
 can't ask consequence questions at the  
 beginning of a conversation because I  
 don't have much trust or credibility  
 this is further on in the conversation  
 probably three fours of the way through  
 when I built a gap from where they are  
 to where they now see they can be now  
 the third thing they do is they also get  
 the prospect to question their way of  
 thinking of why theyve allowed the  
 problems to stay the same why haven't  
 they changed their situation yet what's  
 holding them back okay now in full  
 disclosure I just got out of the  
 hospital okay I had a huge leg operation  
 I've still got an iv in my arm because  
 there was a staff infection that I got  
 at the hospital so you guys are just  
 going to have to deal with it I'm just  
 wearing shorts today my doctor said I'm  
 not even supposed to be walking but I  
 came in here in the office just for you  
 guys because I love you that much all  
 right now I'm going to show you these  
 questions now I'm also going to show you  
 I'm show you generic versions of these  
 and then I picked out about eight or  
 nine different Industries and I'm going  
 to show you how to tie in your industry  
 with consequence questions I'm going to  
 show you the format to do that so make  
 sure you pay attention here this is very  
 important for you right here about what  
 I'm going to show you okay so let me  
 show you the generic versions first and  
 then I'm going to show you more industry  
 specific versions all  
 right okay generic versions what if you  
 don't do anything about this problem and  
 the situation gets even even worse okay  
 now this is generic you're never going  
 to say what if you don't do anything  
 about this problem okay you're going to  
 repeat the actual problem that they told  
 you okay you want to make it specific to  
 that Prospect you don't want to use  
 vague terms like problems situations and  
 solution those are abstract vague terms  
 all right you have to plug in the actual  
 problem and plug in what their real  
 situation is like I said this is generic  
 I'm showing you the generic structure so  
 you can plug that in for your industry  
 or this one right here have you thought  
 about what would happen if you don't do  
 anything about this what happens if you  
 don't do anything about this and this  
 gets worse see that's kind of a concern  
 tone it's also kind of a challenging  
 concern tone that I'm using there I'll  
 show you why I'm using that tone here in  
 a second how about this one have you  
 considered the possible ramifications  
 that the company doesn't change  
 this concern tone now why would I use a  
 concern tone there because a concerned  
 tone tone is a tone that shows empathy  
 it shows that I'm concerned for their  
 situation their problems not getting  
 solved that builds massive trust because  
 they generally feel I'm concerned if I  
 don't use a concerned have you  
 considered the possible ramifications if  
 you don't do anything about this see  
 that monotone voice you will never get  
 the prospect to emotionally open up  
 because you sound like a scripted robot  
 what happens if this doesn't change for  
 you guys that's a concern tone okay a  
 tone that gets them to open up  
 emotionally because there's more trust  
 there they feel like you're generally  
 concerned for them okay now those are  
 three generic neq consequence questions  
 now what I'm also going to do like I  
 said I picked about eight or nine  
 different Industries and I'm going to  
 show you how to break down and how to TI  
 in your industry to those consequence  
 questions okay very important so pay  
 attention all right even if these  
 industries are different than yours now  
 we train 161 different Industries  
 including yours watching me here on this  
 video but I can't show you on this video  
 training 160 different one Industries  
 for consequence questions who've be on  
 here for about 17 years okay so I'm just  
 going to show you a few okay let's say  
 if you sold SAS I'll give you an example  
 for there that's a huge industry retrain  
 I want to say it's about the seventh or  
 eighth largest industry retrain in the  
 world out of 161 Industries Big Industry  
 Force okay now let's say in this example  
 the prospect has a manual process of how  
 they're actually inputting their data  
 for their award ceremonies this is let's  
 say it's a big Enterprise company it's  
 got thousands of employees the judges  
 get pissed off this person's job is to  
 make sure the data is right for the  
 contest and they're having to manually  
 do it a couple of hours a day your pro  
 your SAS your software does it  
 automatically which eliminates those  
 hours a day that the employees have to  
 do it so what if you  
 don't now here's what I want to show you  
 one thing you're going to start start  
 off with a challenging tone and then  
 you're going to end with a concern tone  
 okay it's very important that you  
 understand the differences here so I'm  
 going to start off challenging pay  
 attention to my tonality right here very  
 important for you okay what if you don't  
 get an automated system put in place and  
 you keep losing two hours a day having  
 to do it manually then the judges get  
 pissed off I mean what would happen to  
 your job at that  
 point now the reason why I want to use a  
 challenging tone at the beginning of a  
 consequence question is because my very  
 last question right before that which we  
 call solution run questions gets them to  
 see what the future looks like once the  
 new found problems are solved so they're  
 on emotional High I want to keep that  
 High by asking this in a challenging  
 tone and at the very end I'm going to  
 lower my voice into more of a softer  
 concern tone a tone that shows empathy  
 so what if you don't get this automated  
 system in place and you keep having to  
 spend two hours a day having to do it  
 all manually then the judges get fed up  
 I mean what would happen to your job at  
 that  
 point concern toone okay see the  
 difference in that now let's say if you  
 sold uh index universal life like iuls  
 that's a huge industry retrain as well  
 let me show you the differences here now  
 you're going to notice that the formula  
 the format is the same so I want you to  
 take a pen and a piece of paper watching  
 me here right now take a pen and a piece  
 of paper and start plugging in your  
 industry specifics to the same formula  
 okay  
 so John I mean what's your retirement  
 going to look like if you just stick  
 with a mayor prize's strategy and you  
 keep having all these ups and downs in  
 the market I mean how are you going to  
 be able to retire by the time you're  
 63 if that's what he said he wanted to  
 retire by 63 now I just threw in a  
 financial investment firm called a mar  
 price because that's actually who I use  
 and a mar priz you're not one of our  
 clients yet so I'm going to have to use  
 you in these videos if you don't become  
 a client a maror priz what you doing  
 here so what are what's your retirement  
 going to look like if you just stick  
 with the mayor prizes strategy and you  
 keep having all these ups and downs in  
 the market I mean how are you going to  
 be able to retire by the time you're 63  
 see start off with a challenging tone to  
 keep the emotion high and I end with the  
 concern tone okay now let's say they  
 come back because you got to know what  
 they're going to say oh no I I  
 definitely need to do something well for  
 you though why why look at doing this  
 now I mean why not push it down the road  
 and just hope and pray that the market  
 somehow can stays consistent every year  
 now see what I did this is a question  
 here that gets them to admit that that  
 can never happen so if I sold iuls we  
 all know the market doesn't stay  
 consistent every year for a hundred  
 years there's always ups and downs and  
 iuls that product there causes it to  
 stay not the market to stay consistent  
 but it protects your principle so even  
 if the market goes way down to negative  
 10% you just didn't make anything but if  
 the market goes up 40% maybe only make  
 12% so it's a  
 consistent income okay retirement income  
 but for you I mean why look at doing  
 this now see why look at doing this now  
 like why not push it down the road and  
 just hope and pray that somehow the  
 markets just stay consistent every year  
 Well the reason why I need to do this  
 now is and now they start to defend  
 themselves on why they need to change  
 their situation now see the important  
 word here is now okay but for you why  
 look at doing this now why not push it  
 down the road like a lot of people do  
 and just hope and pray that the Market's  
 just going to somehow stay consistent  
 every year when they start telling you  
 why they need to do it now they're also  
 telling who themselves see how they're  
 defending themselves on why they need to  
 change now that builds massive urgency  
 in the sale for them to buy now not keep  
 pushing it down the road but I could  
 never do that if I didn't know how to  
 ask those type of questions and  
 especially how to use my tone all right  
 does that make sense now in the chats or  
 in the comments type in me if that makes  
 sense to you what I just did there now  
 let me show you a few more Industries  
 here completely different ones but I'm  
 going to show you the formulas the same  
 let's say if you sold dental implants  
 it's a big industry for us as well we  
 train one of the biggest companies in  
 the United States up in Salt Lake City  
 Utah that do D imp plants they do  
 hundreds of millions a year in sales but  
 what happens if you don't do anything  
 about this and you keep losing the bone  
 density in your jaw  
 and now you can't even get implants at  
 that point oh well see challenging to  
 concern tone now let's say they come  
 back because they could come back and  
 say well I don't know I guess I'll just  
 hope and pray that something works out  
 okay or they give you something well I  
 don't know I just have to figure  
 something out well I mean do you do you  
 want to have to keep living with all  
 that pain in your mouth if you I mean if  
 you didn't have to do you want to have  
 to keep living with all that pain in  
 your mouth if you I mean if you didn't  
 have to well no if I didn't have to well  
 whose choice is it see see how I'm doing  
 that now if you're looking for npq  
 consequence questions for your industry  
 uh first thing for you to do go a And  
 subscribe to this channel I will tell  
 you let me give you let me give you a  
 word of advice so just some  
 caution do not share if you subscribe to  
 this channel do not share this with your  
 competitors okay so if you have a friend  
 that sells the same thing you do that  
 you compete with don't share the YouTube  
 video with them because you don't want  
 them to know what I'm showing you here  
 on this Vibe board because you're  
 competing against them so if you're  
 going to subscribe to the channel make  
 sure you only share it with salespeople  
 that are outside of your industry so you  
 don't have to compete with them all  
 right take my advice on that I promise  
 you on that let's go to another industry  
 specific example let's say if you sell  
 solar now this is I want to say the  
 fifth or sixth largest industry in the  
 world we train huge industry Force say  
 same thing remember I'm going to start  
 off with a challenging tone and then in  
 with a concern tone what happens if you  
 don't do anything about this Edison  
 keeps raising your rates every year like  
 they have but now you know 25 years  
 later you're 75 80 years old and you're  
 St to pay the bill every month but  
 where's the bill going to be in 25 years  
 yeah like three or four times higher but  
 now you're on a retirement income and  
 the bill is four times higher I mean how  
 would you guys pay for it at that  
 point challenging tone to concern tone  
 now what are these little periods here  
 these are verbal pauses so anytime you  
 ask a question that is a long question  
 you have to learn how to have verbal  
 pauses in there and how to Pace out the  
 question so it doesn't go too fast  
 because the one of the biggest reasons  
 why your prospects give you vague  
 generalized surface level answers is  
 because you ask your questions so fast  
 and when you ask questions so fast you  
 give them no time to think deeper and  
 internalize what you just asked because  
 you ask it too fast so you get vague  
 reaction answers and they don't go below  
 the surface that's why you get a lot of  
 objections at the end okay let's go to a  
 completely different industry let's say  
 if you sold employee benefits huge  
 industry retraining as well same formula  
 and let's say that they're losing some  
 of their top Executives to a competitor  
 that's offering them better benefits and  
 you can solve that okay but on the flip  
 side I mean what happens to you if you  
 guys just stay on this plan and your top  
 people keep going over to XYZ competitor  
 because they get better benefits I mean  
 what are the consequences for the  
 company at that  
 point challenging tone start off the  
 question to a concern tone a tone that  
 shows empathy you see with me on there  
 oh I don't know we'd have to figure  
 something I mean do you want to have to  
 keep going through all that if you I  
 mean if you didn't have to this you  
 don't have to use every time it just  
 depends on how they answer this question  
 right here sometimes I'll answer that  
 seven different ways uh if you're  
 looking for every single way to answer  
 based off their answer you'll probably  
 want to get in our virtual training  
 courses because we train you all that in  
 there this is just a a basic training  
 here that I'm doing for you okay you'd  
 want to get in a client training that  
 has all the answers in there okay let's  
 say if you sold cars okay big indust we  
 training as well and let's say that the  
 car they have now keeps breaking down  
 when they go to work they're late they  
 feel like their boss is going to fire  
 them if it happens again okay so what  
 happens if you just keep your car and it  
 keeps breaking down on your way to work  
 I mean what would happen to your job at  
 that  
 point concern tone challenging tone to  
 concern tone okay okay oh they like oh I  
 I definitely have to get a different  
 okay so it's important for you to do  
 something then  
 okay uh it just depends I could say this  
 as well I mean you want to keep putting  
 yourself in that situation if you I mean  
 if you didn't have to now I have to ask  
 that in a concern tone right because if  
 I ask it in like a defensive tone like  
 well do you want to keep putting  
 yourself in this situation if you didn't  
 have to the prospect's going to get what  
 defensive but if I use a concern tone  
 with my hand on my chest I mean you want  
 to have to put yourself in that  
 situation if you you know if you didn't  
 have to concern tone they don't get  
 defensive because they feel like I'm  
 genuinely concerned for the consequence  
 if they don't change you with me on that  
 okay let me show you a few more here  
 real quick you want me to show you a few  
 more or just shut it all down right now  
 should I just shut it all down show you  
 a few more what do you want me to do  
 okay let's say if you sold cyber  
 security this is another Big Industry we  
 trained one of the top 30 Industries so  
 if you continue to use XYZ vendor what  
 are the  
 consequences if you don't do anything  
 about your false positive rates and you  
 guys just continually keep rejecting a  
 lot of good customers let's say if I'm  
 selling to a bank okay so if they don't  
 do anything about changing their false  
 positive rates because they don't have  
 the right Security in there okay they  
 rejecting all these good customers the  
 bottom line of the bank suffers because  
 of that okay if they give me a negative  
 response like oh I don't know we have to  
 figure something I mean do you want to  
 have to have that keep happening to your  
 bank if you I mean if you guys didn't  
 have to okay see what I'm doing there  
 okay let me go through another one or  
 two here okay let's say you're a  
 marriage therapist I'm I'm showing you  
 all different niches today different  
 industries that have nothing to do with  
 each other but what are you noticing  
 about each industry I'm showing that  
 what the for formula is the exact same  
 there's no difference here see what I'm  
 doing here what if you don't do anything  
 about this and you keep having these  
 issues with Bob where you're just  
 arguing and you just keep feeling all  
 this resentment and that keeps going on  
 like I don't know another three six or  
 12 months I mean what's going to happen  
 to your marriage at that  
 point now they think deeper internalize  
 what is going to happen if they keep  
 arguing and resenting each other for  
 another 6 to 12 months the marriage is  
 over okay or what about this I could  
 lean in sometimes with a consequence  
 question and just say it more simply  
 what happens to your marriage if this  
 doesn't  
 change what happens to your marriage if  
 you don't go through counseling  
 together concern toone okay so why look  
 at doing therapy now I mean why not push  
 it down the road like a lot of couples  
 do who end up getting divorced well the  
 reason why we have to do it now is and  
 the prospect tells you why they're doing  
 it but more importantly who are they  
 telling themselves that builds massive  
 urgency for them to want to change and  
 do that with you are you with me on what  
 that does okay all right let me show you  
 another one here let's see what we got  
 here all right let's say if you sold  
 General Life Insurance here biggest in I  
 think it's the first or second largest  
 industry we train in the world now so I  
 mean what if you don't do anything about  
 this Dan and you I don't know you end up  
 passing away years before you thought  
 you would cuz none of us know when I  
 mean how would Cindy end up paying for  
 the house house and all the expenses at  
 that point without your income that  
 causes Dan to internalize oh crap how is  
 she going to pay let's say that that uh  
 you know Dan is a corporate executive  
 and Cindy wanted to be a teacher because  
 she wanted to have her Summers off and  
 be with their kids so her income is less  
 than the corporate executive and that  
 example I mean do you want her to have  
 to go through all that if you if you  
 didn't have to let me give you a  
 different example let's say if you sold  
 mortgage protection okay I'll just kind  
 of show you how this roleplay could go  
 so so Dan if we lost your income of the  
 9,000 a month how many months would  
 Cindy be able to pay for the mortgage  
 without your income now what if Dan come  
 back and says well I'm not really  
 sure what are you g to do oh okay and go  
 to the next question no you got to find  
 out well if you really thought about  
 that how many months could she even pay  
 it well if you really thought about that  
 how many months that's when any Prospect  
 says I'm not really sure you say Well if  
 you really thought about it and that  
 automatically makes the prospect do what  
 think about the question you just asked  
 are you with me on that okay now let's  
 say if they come back oh I don't know  
 probably four or five months so I mean  
 what what happens to her and the  
 kids at that point  
 though concern  
 to now the prospect thinks what oh  
 crap that's not good they're going to be  
 on their own after four or five months  
 because I don't have the right insurance  
 policy to pay for that I don't know I  
 guess they'd have to sell the house and  
 move let's say if they said I don't know  
 I guess they'd have to sell the house to  
 move well I mean what happens if they  
 can't sell it that quickly because of  
 the high interest rates that are going  
 on now now I get him to think like oh  
 crap maybe they can't sell the home in  
 two or three months and it's going to go  
 into foreclosure and they lose all that  
 Equity well I guess they just have to  
 accept a lower  
 offer well I mean do you want them to  
 have to move and go through all that if  
 you I mean if you didn't have to concern  
 to well no not at all right Well you  
 certainly now here's the way I'm going  
 to push them away I'm going to push them  
 away to get them to pull me back in well  
 I mean you certainly sound motivated but  
 for you why look at doing this now I  
 mean why not push it down the road like  
 a lot of guys do who end up leaving all  
 their burden and stress on their spouse  
 that they leave behind for you why look  
 at do I mean you certainly sound  
 motivated but for you why look at doing  
 this now though see the key word here is  
 now see I'm building urgency why look at  
 doing this now why not see I'm going to  
 pause there why look at doing this now  
 why not push it down the road like a lot  
 of people do who end up leaving all that  
 burden and stress on their spouse's  
 shoulders well the reason why I need to  
 doal good doing this now is because of  
 and they start telling themselves why  
 they're doing it which is the highest  
 form of persuasion you see what we're  
 doing there okay let me show you another  
 example I'm just warming up here for you  
 guys let's say if you sold Home  
 Improvement Home Improvement gosh I want  
 to say maybe the fourth or fifth largest  
 industry we train now now it's a big one  
 okay let's say if you sold pools and  
 let's say that you found out that uh the  
 grandparents want to put a pig nice pool  
 in their backyard because their  
 grandkids are driving down to the MC  
 YMCA and they're missing out on all  
 those memories that they want to make in  
 the Summers with their grandkids  
 grandkids don't want to come over  
 because they don't have a pool and it's  
 hot so you live in Florida so what  
 happens if you don't end up putting a  
 pool in and the grandkids keep having to  
 go all the way down to the YMCA and you  
 guys miss out on all those memories of  
 the grandkids growing up okay and I'm  
 going to repeat back this in this  
 example I'm repeating back a negative  
 consequence of the problem oh I don't  
 know I well do you want to have  
 to I mean I don't want to say this but  
 do you want to have to miss out on all  
 those memories with them if you I mean  
 if you didn't have to well no if I  
 didn't have to so how now I could ask a  
 qualifying so how important is it for  
 you to change your situation put the  
 pullback in and actually have those  
 memories with the grandkids you're going  
 to remember forever okay I could ask  
 that if I wanted to that's an npq  
 qualifying question let's say if I sold  
 software I mean I literally could show  
 you this for every single industry we  
 already train well we train there's 163  
 Industries on the planet according to  
 Forbes Magazine there's subcategories of  
 each we on all of those we train 161 of  
 163 including yours uh watching me in  
 this video okay but on the flip side  
 what happens if you don't do anything  
 about this your reps keep using those  
 spreadsheets and you you keep losing  
 that on 12 plus deals every month and  
 that just keeps going on month after  
 month I mean what is your what is your  
 boss going to do to you at that point if  
 they said they're losing deals because  
 they don't have a CRM they're just  
 manually keeping track of sales and  
 leads okay I I mean you certainly s well  
 no I need to do something for sure you  
 certainly sound motivated but what are  
 the ramifications for you personally if  
 this doesn't get fixed oh gosh I might  
 lose my job do you want to have to lose  
 your job though if you didn't have to  
 see what I'm doing there okay nice and  
 simple stuff here let's say if you sold  
 Fitness it's a big industry for us let's  
 say you work at a gym you're a personal  
 trainer you do weight loss it doesn't  
 matter what happens if you don't start  
 losing this 125 pounds now let's say  
 that they felt like they're 125 lbs  
 overweight so what happens if you don't  
 start losing this 125 lb Prospect oh I  
 don't know I I guess I die early or  
 maybe they say well I don't know I I  
 just I don't know what would what would  
 well if you really thought about what  
 what's going to happen with all that  
 weight being pushed on your organs every  
 day yeah I want to have a heart attack  
 well are you willing to let that happen  
 to your daughter so let's say their  
 their concern was that they weren't  
 going to live long enough to walk their  
 daughter down the aisle because they're  
 125 pounds overweight and with that  
 weight as you know it's crushing your  
 organs every day all that weight on your  
 heart and your your uh your you know  
 your whatever's in here all the stuff  
 right uh are you willing to let that  
 happen to her though I have to ask that  
 in a concerned tone because if I well  
 are you willing to let that happen to  
 your daughter well no you you know  
 they're going to get defensive are you  
 willing to let that happen though okay  
 well no no way I mean you certainly  
 sound motivated I mean for you why look  
 at doing this now though why not keep  
 pushing down the road like a lot of dads  
 do who end up just dying years before  
 they thought before they should  
 well the reason why I have to do this  
 now is okay see what we're doing there

 if you got a friend that sells the same  
 thing you do probably don't share the  
 Channel with them because you're  
 competing with them you don't want them  
 to know the stuff that I share with you  
 on this channel right so only share it

\# How to Sell Anything to Anyone with this Unusual Method (NEPQ Full Breakdown)  
\# https://www.youtube.com/watch/5enPMakCGXU

 hey are you a salesperson that wants to  
 learn how to sell far more than you are  
 now you could be one of these five  
 people you could be a salesperson that's  
 like way below the average and you know  
 you're about to get fired if you don't  
 learn how to sell more you could be a  
 salesperson that's average but you're  
 like hey I need to get really good at  
 this so I can control my own destiny  
 make more sales make more money you  
 might be a good salesperson but you're  
 like man I want to become the best in my  
 office number one person get all the  
 company Awards or maybe you're the best  
 in your company but you're like I need  
 to acquire more skills to be become the  
 best in the entire industry where  
 everybody knows I am the very best  
 there's no doubt about it so if you're  
 one of those five people entrepreneurs  
 business owners salespeople sales  
 managers coaches Consultants anybody  
 that's selling anything that wants to  
 persuade anybody to do anything you want  
 to sell more of your thing I'm going to  
 show you what is being called the new  
 model of selling inq by tens of  
 thousands of salespeople pretty much in  
 every country and every industry  
 including yours watching me come over  
 this Vibe board I'm going to break down  
 the new model of selling versus maybe  
 how you've been forced to sell by the  
 company you work for or for some sales  
 Guru never really was that successful at  
 sales thems or maybe they haven't sold  
 for decades comeing over the buyboard  
 I'm going to break down the new model of  
 selling for you and give you different  
 industry specific examples if you want  
 to sell more of your product your  
 service your thing come on over here I'm  
 going to show you all right so I'm going  
 to show you the differences between what  
 we call the old model of selling  
 compared to neq the new model of selling  
 and then I'm going to show you some  
 industry specific examples and kind of  
 break down the psychology behind each  
 stage of neq now remember that stands  
 for neuro emotional persuasion question  
 neq okay so here's kind of the here's  
 kind of like the old way of selling this  
 would be called like the Ia model of  
 selling uh it can be repackaged as  
 consultative selling you might have  
 heard of that this is known as more of  
 the old model IA model it's repackaged  
 as consultative selling as well stands  
 for attention interest desire action  
 okay let let me put this down here a  
 little bit compared to inq which we call  
 the new model of selling neuro emotional  
 persuasion questions new model old model  
 now if you look at here this might be  
 familiar to some of you the old model  
 I'm just going to break this down for  
 you the old model was the first 10% was  
 really uh you know kind of trying to  
 build report you were taught to ask them  
 like hey how's how's your day going how  
 you doing today how's the weather you  
 know if you're if you're on Zoom where  
 do you live um if you're on the phone uh  
 did you see the game last night you're  
 trying to identify with common beliefs  
 that is kind of the old way that you  
 were taught to build rapport okay we  
 call that actually fake Rapport because  
 do your prospects have they heard that  
 before what are some predictable  
 questions they are used to every  
 salesperson that's ever tried to sell  
 them anything ask how you doing today  
 how's your day going how's the weather  
 over there and they know what you're  
 trying to do so a lot of prospects  
 interpret those type of questions as I'm  
 just trying to get you to like me so I  
 can sell you my product my service my  
 thing and you'll notice they kind of  
 shut down they kind of emotionally start  
 to stay surface love with you you want  
 to stay away from predictable questions  
 that every salese salesperson uses  
 because the prospect they have that  
 script in their brain so if you sound  
 like other salespeople they treat you  
 like other sales people lower status  
 right you don't want to act like that  
 okay and a lot of it kind of gets them  
 into I hate to say this price or cost  
 based thinking early on okay we want to  
 get them in results based thinking I'm  
 going to show you that in a second now  
 the next 10% was kind of asking just  
 going to be r with you kind of surface  
 level questions uh hey what keeps you  
 awake at night what are some two  
 challenges that you're having what are  
 you looking for a solution now those are  
 what we would say logical based  
 questions but the problem is to human  
 beings by on logic or emotion emotion  
 okay 100% there's no there's no uh  
 debate in Behavioral Science on this the  
 brain studies prove this okay I feel  
 like a drink of water because I'm  
 thirsty I feel like see every decision  
 you make starts with your emotional side  
 of your brain I feel like checking my  
 phone because maybe my dad just sent me  
 a text or maybe my girlfriend or  
 something okay see now the next so so  
 like the first 20% fake Rapport  
 questions every salesperson asks how you  
 doing today surface level questions what  
 are two problems that keep you awake at  
 night what are you looking for in  
 solution what's your budget for this  
 type of thing and then we go into to  
 what we call features and benefits okay  
 so they give you a problem oh I'm having  
 this problem and you start selling to  
 that problem you start selling to that  
 need the problem is is you don't really  
 help them relive their pain you don't  
 really open them up emotionally they you  
 just go off their surface level answer  
 to one of your surface level questions  
 okay and then you start going into your  
 presentation and that's like half of the  
 conversation talking about all the  
 features and benefits and how you have  
 the best this and the best that which  
 how many salese say they  
 have the best product or service or  
 they're the number one in the market  
 everyone right even if you are most  
 prospects don't believe you are because  
 they used to once again every  
 salesperson saying and sounding the same  
 way and then it's at last 30 seconds we  
 try to close it's buy or die High sales  
 pressure okay objection handling and  
 that's a deal so like 50% presentation  
 30% closing and objection handling and  
 really only 10% questions with another  
 10% fake report okay now this model  
 right here the old model this is where  
 we get the numbers game mentality hey  
 sales is a numbers game just call more  
 leads work harder knock more doors get  
 more nose to get that yes now that game  
 you could you can do decent at but  
 there's going to be a level at caps you  
 at and a lot of people burn out because  
 they can't take the emotional rejection  
 of being rejected by most Prospect human  
 beings were not developed to just have  
 thick skin and just go through the  
 numbers and motions that's why selling  
 has the highest attrition of any  
 profession in the world because of this  
 selling model and other forms of it that  
 causes the very sales resistance and  
 objections that you don't like okay so  
 what I did in my Behavioral Science  
 Background is I looked at this model cuz  
 I'm a weirdo and I questioned everything  
 I'm like well why why are we doing it  
 this way even as a 22-year-old kid I'm  
 like I don't understand why is it buy or  
 die now you can't get to the end and be  
 like well let me know if uh if you're  
 interested like you can't be all timid  
 you have to be seen as the expert The  
 Trusted Authority right so you have to  
 close all right or at least move the  
 sale forward if you're more of a complex  
 selling environment in B2B okay so what  
 I wanted to do is I'm like how do I flip  
 the model how do I flip this okay so if  
 you don't if you know my background I  
 went to school for Behavioral Science  
 human psychology and I released studied  
 social dynamics in uh concepts of what  
 we call rank framing how people would  
 rank themselves in society throughout  
 all history of society okay how are you  
 how are you how are how is your status  
 or your rank viewed in our society today  
 the two biggest things are your social  
 media following right and your wealth  
 that is typically how most people are  
 ranked and have status in our society  
 now let's say you lived on the  
 Polynesian Islands a thousand years ago  
 how would your status be ranked by the  
 tribal tattoos you had on your arms  
 would show your rank in society or in  
 medieval times if you're a duke or a  
 knight or Prince see that's how you were  
 ranked that's rank framing or status  
 framing okay so as a salesperson how how  
 how does society typically view  
 salespeople in general lower status  
 right even if you make $600,000 a year  
 you might make more than a doctor the  
 doctor is going to be viewed far higher  
 higher status than you are right they've  
 got a degree on the wall they've got the  
 white coat they have respect you could  
 be making twice as much as that doctor  
 but you're still going to be viewed at a  
 lower status so I'm like how do I how do  
 we flip this because if if nothing is  
 sold there is no economy right  
 everything has to be sold to have an  
 economy everything that you have right  
 now and your possession was sold  
 somebody sold that okay Society does not  
 function without an economy so if  
 there's no selling there's no economy  
 that means there's no Society I mean  
 there's we've been selling stuff since  
 the dawn ages of man whenever that was  
 that's all debatable when God put the  
 first humans here so I wanted to flip  
 this how do I raise my status in the  
 prospect's mind where they view me at at  
 a higher status than them in what I'm  
 talking about we call that situational  
 status or rank status and social  
 dynamics okay I'm getting kind of nerdy  
 here with the science stuff now so what  
 I wanted to do cuz I found that really I  
 found really the sale is not made with a  
 closing question like do you want the  
 red one or the blue one that's not when  
 the prospect as you know decides to buy  
 if they're like I want the blue one that  
 means they had already decided that  
 before you asked them that question and  
 where did they decide it that they  
 decided that in the engagement part of  
 the conversation does that make sense to  
 you when you built a gap from where they  
 are to where they want to be they felt  
 so much internal tension or need that  
 they felt like I have to change okay  
 what are the two biggest emotional  
 drivers that causes human being to want  
 to change pain and the fear of future  
 pain if we can't help them relive their  
 pain or have a fear of future pain they  
 feel no need to change and if they feel  
 no need to change that's why you get  
 tons of objections and that's why they  
 don't buy from you so I wanted to flip  
 that so how do I first of all how do I  
 spend 85% of that conversation building  
 trust and getting so the first thing I  
 have to do is I have to get them to let  
 their guard down I'm going to show you  
 to do that with neq connection questions  
 if I can get them to let their guard  
 down they emotionally start to open up  
 but most sales people because we're  
 using these old techniques trigger sales  
 resistance early on and the guard comes  
 up and do you ever notice when you ask  
 questions that you thought were good a  
 lot of your prospects give you vague  
 generalized surface level answers that's  
 because they have resistance right  
 something you said or how you use your  
 tone triggered them to stay surface  
 level they don't want to open up so how  
 do I change that by getting them to the  
 guard down I'm show you some examples  
 then immediately how do I get them into  
 results based thinking okay if I can get  
 this over results based thinking over  
 price or cost based I'm going to show  
 you a few examples how do I then help  
 them find problems they didn't know they  
 have that's called problem finding how  
 do then I build a gap from where they  
 are to where they want to be not by  
 telling them that goes in one ear out  
 the other but by my questioning my tone  
 allows them to feel that tension  
 themselves and then how do I also  
 prevent objections from happening so if  
 you're in an so everybody knows what  
 objections you get for your industry  
 right so how about I ask questions in  
 that process that prevent those  
 objections from even happening in their  
 mind now that doesn't mean you're going  
 to prevent 100% objections but if we  
 could show you how to prevent even half  
 of the objections you get Now by default  
 you're going to do what sell more than  
 you are now okay and then how do we  
 future Pace how do we get them to see  
 what the future looks like once the new  
 found problems are solved and all of  
 this builds trust I always say this  
 people buy from people from salespeople  
 or companies they trust can get them the  
 best result they do not buy just because  
 they like you right you like a lot of  
 your friends would you ever do business  
 with them ah no because you don't trust  
 that they have the business skills to be  
 successful you're still like them but  
 you don't trust them that they can get  
 you the best result you love Grandma but  
 you might meet a complete stranger  
 selling the same thing as grandma and if  
 you feel that complete stranger is going  
 to get you a better result and Grandma  
 who are you going to buy from you're  
 going to buy from the stranger you love  
 grandma though okay doesn't mean you  
 want them to hate you though okay but  
 liking you is just secondary to trusting  
 you that you can get them the best  
 result those are two very different  
 things okay and then I only need to  
 spend about 10% of that conversation or  
 conversations presenting my solution to  
 solve their problem s okay cuz I already  
 know how to present it and position it  
 in away because they've already told me  
 everything they want to need okay and  
 then closing is really just getting them  
 to commit to take to the next step  
 that's like 2 to 5% of the sales process  
 closing is not like a 30% thing okay so  
 I wanted to go over that just kind of so  
 you could see the differences so I want  
 to show you one last thing so right here  
 this is the key 85% of you making that  
 sale is in right here the engagement  
 stage right here like what's going on 8  
 5% 85% is building trust and building  
 Gap and I'm going to show you questions  
 to use not how are you doing today  
 questions that build trust by getting  
 the prospect to think deeper about their  
 current situation and the consequences  
 if it doesn't change and where they want  
 to be all right now let's go into the  
 first part of npq now this is called let  
 me find it here wrote this all up for  
 you consequence questions okay now  
 consequence questions are very important  
 here's the kind of the psychology behind  
 it first of all consequence questions  
 immediately take the focus off of you  
 and puts it on your prospect right why  
 would you want to do that because if  
 you're just focused on you what do they  
 feel salesperson trying to sell me  
 something so I take that Focus off me  
 put on them immediately because people  
 want to talk about themselves right then  
 I have to get them quickly into what we  
 call let's see results based thinking  
 over price or cost based thinking see if  
 you're just selling on price and cost  
 what happens well you get commoditized  
 so they always want cheaper deals and  
 they keep looking around Price shopping  
 I'm getting them into results based  
 thinking when I was in the trenches for  
 almost 18 years as a salesperson like  
 you okay making multiple seven figures a  
 year in Commissions in the four  
 Industries I sold it 2 B2B 2 b2c I  
 rarely had a prospect that ever said hey  
 can you give me a cheaper price or hey  
 I'm talking with competitor and they're  
 five or 10% cheaper than you you know  
 why because I knew how to keep and get  
 them into results based syncing where  
 even if my product or service was 10 15%  
 more they were still buying for me  
 because they trust that I could get them  
 the best result and people will pay more  
 if they trust you can do that okay now  
 we're also going to use connection  
 questions to disarm the prospect to get  
 them to let their guard down and I'm  
 going to show you specifically in this  
 video you're watching how to use your  
 tonality to actually cause your prospect  
 to open up engage with you let's go and  
 take a look at neq connection question  
 so they do three main things first of  
 all they're going to take the focus off  
 of you immediately put it on the  
 prospect okay very very quickly Split  
 Second doesn't matter if it's inbound  
 leads it booked on your calendar if it's  
 an outbound lead who put in their name  
 email and phone number from some type of  
 AD you're calling them back they just  
 don't know who's calling them when or it  
 could even be a cold call or it could be  
 door to door it really does not matter  
 B2 B B to C I'm going to show you a few  
 different examples the second it does is  
 it immediately gets the prospect into  
 what we call results based thinking over  
 price or cost based thinking so if you  
 get a lot of objections like your price  
 is too high can you do it cheaper I'm  
 just shopping around I want to compare  
 vendors that's because you haven't  
 learned yet how to take them from Price  
 or cost based thinking into results  
 based thinking results based thinking  
 doesn't matter if your prices are 10 20%  
 more than others if they feel like you  
 can get them the best result they will  
 always pay more than the company or  
 product or service that they don't  
 really know can get them that same  
 result I'll show you a few examples of  
 that and then really the most important  
 thing is it helps to disarm the prospect  
 quickly in that conversation where they  
 let their guard down how many times have  
 you noticed uh when you ask a lot of  
 your prospects questions a lot of them  
 give you vague generalized surus level  
 answers they don't emotionally open up  
 and human beings Buy on logic or emotion  
 brain study show it's 100% emotion okay  
 I feel like a drink of water right now  
 right every decision you make starts  
 with your emotional side of your brain  
 and you justify with logic okay I'll  
 show you a few examples of that now  
 there's a couple different ways to play  
 the ball game of  
 sales and if you're one of our clients  
 you know we train a lot about this there  
 is what most salese have been taught the  
 numbers game approach okay call more  
 leads knock more doors talk to more  
 prospects this is all going to depend on  
 your industry and okay uh talk to more  
 people you're going to get a lot of NOS  
 but you're looking for that yes you got  
 to get thick skin tons of rejection work  
 harder now that way of selling has  
 gotten you where to where you're at  
 nothing more nothing more because  
 there's a cap because this you're just  
 going through the numbers you run out a  
 time I would rather focus on the skills  
 game strategy where I'm focused on the  
 quality of each conversation meaning the  
 questions I'm asking I'm always trying  
 to tweak those to make them the best to  
 get the prospect to internalize more  
 pain more problems okay I want to get  
 much better at learning how to use my  
 tone my tonality to cause the prospect  
 to let their guard down so they're not  
 surface level I want to get much better  
 at problem finding helping them find  
 problems they didn't realize they had CU  
 if you're able to help them not just  
 find one problem but if you learn the  
 skills to help them find two or three or  
 four or five of problems they didn't  
 realize they had how do they start to  
 view you more like an expert okay  
 somebody they can trust because they've  
 never they've never  
 internalized uh the questions they've  
 never had sales people ask them the same  
 type of questions we're going to train  
 you especially if you're a client we'll  
 show a few examples here and how do we  
 help them find problems they didn't know  
 they had okay so Skills game or the  
 numbers game I want to play the skills  
 game so as an example rather than  
 getting one sale out of every 10 Pro  
 Prospects I talk to why not learn how to  
 develop a higher skill level and sell 6  
 out of 10 or 7 out of 10 or higher  
 that's the skills game approach you work  
 less you make way more sales you make  
 more commissions and you help way more  
 people solve their problems and get what  
 they want okay now one thing that we all  
 have to understand this kind on  
 Behavioral Science 101 within the first  
 5 to 12 seconds of any sales  
 conversation you're ever going to be in  
 it doesn't matter if it's in person on  
 the phone uh you know in an office  
 setting in a house setting it doesn't  
 really matter your prospects are picking  
 up on social cues from you  
 subconsciously they can't even help it  
 because we're human and they're picking  
 up on your non-verbal and verbal cues  
 based on your  
 tonality and what you are saying and  
 asking in your body language they can  
 see you that triggers their brain to  
 react in one of two ways okay if you  
 come across too excited okay now I don't  
 mean be boring or timid okay but if you  
 come across way enthusiastic like a  
 salesperson does okay if you come across  
 needy if you if you come across like  
 you're attached and you're pushy and you  
 don't understand the right questions to  
 ask with the tone that triggers what we  
 call fight ORF flight mode you ever  
 heard of fight ORF flight mode you've  
 heard of it but do you know what  
 triggers that in your prospect's brain  
 it's actually your tonality that  
 triggers that I'm going to show you a  
 few examples okay now when we play the  
 skills game approach okay if you're if  
 you get our Advanced Training we show  
 you a little bit here on YouTube we're  
 going to train you how to be how to come  
 across more neutral more unbiased like  
 you're not quite sure you can even help  
 yet you don't know enough details now as  
 you build the Gap you become more  
 assumptive but in the beginning I have  
 to get them to let their guard down okay  
 and I'll show you what I mean by that  
 you're going to learn how to come across  
 more calm Collective and detached more  
 like an expert does who doesn't need the  
 business because they've got lots of  
 business they're the expert they trust  
 authority of course everybody's coming  
 to them okay that triggers the brain to  
 get them to let their guard down where  
 they become curious enough to want to  
 engage with you and have an open  
 conversation okay there's way more trust  
 there okay now I'm going to show you a  
 few different ways to actually do this  
 now this right here is very generic okay  
 I'm going to show you generic couple  
 ways and then I'm going to show you a  
 couple industry specific ways now if you  
 want far more details far more advanced  
 training uh just message us directly  
 somebody can reach out to you and go  
 through the details all right yes is  
 let's say this is an outbound lead  
 somebody's put in their name email phone  
 number okay and they know somebody's  
 calling them back they just don't know  
 who went you're going to get some paper  
 not kidding you it's a pattern erupt if  
 they hear the paper on the phone  
 triggers curiosity what are they  
 shuffling okay these are panars you  
 don't want to sound like every  
 salesperson's ever called them because  
 they put you in that bucket and they're  
 not interested we don't need it can't  
 afford it so this is outbound lead not  
 cold calling yeah is this John yeah hey  
 John it's it's Jeremy Jeremy Jeremy  
 Miner uh with XYZ company it looks like  
 you recently responded to an ad and you  
 asked us to call you back about looking  
 at getting possible help with your blank  
 so that you guys could blank right now  
 we're going to plug in the problem and  
 repeat back the end result of what we do  
 okay that's going to depend on the  
 industry and I'll show you a few  
 different examples now that's just one  
 example of how to start an outbound call  
 with connection questions the next  
 question this is very generic hey so  
 when you went through through the ad and  
 you saw XYZ what was it that they were I  
 guess going over that caused you to you  
 know want to want to look into this  
 further okay that is just another  
 connection question to get them to tell  
 you why they're looking but more  
 importantly who are they telling they're  
 telling themselves why they're looking  
 now there's a lot more to that I'm just  
 giving you kind of an overview in this  
 uh video here on YouTube okay now  
 inbound leads a little bit different  
 let's say they book on your calendar and  
 you're meeting them on Zoom okay get on  
 Zoom hey hey all right hey John welcome  
 over here can you can you hear me okay  
 oh okay yeah you go back okay and can  
 you can you see me you only say that if  
 they have their video turned off and  
 I'll show you what I'm why I'm doing  
 that in other trainings okay so it looks  
 like you booked on the calendar about  
 possibly getting help with your blank so  
 that you guys are able to blank right  
 now repeating back the end result of  
 what you do I start to get them into  
 results based thinking okay over price  
 or cost based thinking now let me show  
 you a few different industry specific  
 examples okay in this example let's say  
 you sell for an auto dealership that's a  
 big industry retraining as well okay  
 let's you're say you're an internet  
 manager somebody sees a red Audi okay or  
 whatever online fills out the form they  
 know somebody's calling them back from  
 the dealership they don't know who and  
 when yes this John hey John it's it's  
 Jeremy Jeremy Miner from from XYZ Audi  
 you asked us to call you back back it  
 looks like you just responded to an ad  
 on Facebook this morning about possibly  
 looking at that uh 2022 red A6 Audi  
 right in result okay if I'm selling cars  
 okay then I'm tweaking this a little bit  
 yeah we just got that car in a trade in  
 that you were looking at what I guess  
 what aspects of the car cause you to  
 maybe maybe want to test drive it okay  
 I'm slowing down my tone that's called  
 verbal pacing I won't get into the  
 details of what that means in this video  
 okay now here's another one connection  
 question ah okay and you know what type  
 of vehicle you might be looking for  
 besides just the red Audi just in case  
 it's already gone by the time you get  
 down here to look at it I'm also finding  
 out what other cars they interested in  
 and I'm also building urgency not by  
 saying oh there's lots of people looking  
 at you better get down here before it's  
 gone most people don't believe you even  
 if that's the case that's like fake  
 urgency just because I'm saying just in  
 case it's already gone by the time you  
 get down here to look at it so I'm  
 applying that but a less in a way that  
 sounds more believable just in case cuz  
 it could be gone okay now there's a lot  
 more to that in other trainings we'll  
 show you that now let's say if you sold  
 SAS I just I'm going to show you  
 different parts of connection questions  
 let's say this is an inbound lead an SDR  
 code called book this onto your calendar  
 okay in this example let's say you sell  
 SAS for associations okay to help them  
 get rid of the manual process with their  
 data and this is all done now uh  
 streamlined and automated by your  
 product your service okay so it looks  
 like you uh booked in with us to look at  
 possible outside help with your Awards  
 program and maybe being able to automate  
 that process right see if I'm selling  
 SAS for associations who are doing it  
 manually the end result is you're not  
 selling SAS you're selling the results  
 of what your service does which is to  
 automate the process reduce their time  
 they have to spend on it manually lots  
 more stuff okay there's more to that now  
 same thing let's go to another industry  
 I'll show you a few here you're going to  
 show this very similar now let's say you  
 sell HVAC it's a big industry R training  
 as well and let's say you have an inhome  
 appointment that set was set up by the  
 technician who was there a week ago to  
 look at their heating and cooling system  
 that had broken down okay so it looks  
 like uh okay yeah so one of our  
 technicians Ryan I guess he was just out  
 here and scheduled and you guys  
 scheduled about possibly looking at  
 maybe upgrading your heating and cooling  
 system to he had mentioned get kind of  
 the air circulating in the upstairs so  
 your kids are able to sleep better at  
 night right if that was the case I'm  
 just plugging in the end result of what  
 you do you're not selling heating and  
 cooling systems you're selling the  
 results of what the heating and cooling  
 system does for them in this case let's  
 say they want to cool the upstairs  
 better because they're younger kids it's  
 hot up there they're having a hard time  
 sleeping in the Summers I just plug that  
 in okay so hey when you were talking to  
 Ryan besides just obviously wanting to  
 get air conditioning upstairs what was  
 is it that he kind of mentioned that  
 caused you to you know want to want to  
 look into this further that's another  
 connection question okay I'm going to  
 show you one or two more here let's say  
 if you sell Financial Services now  
 you're going to notice that the formula  
 is very similar on every industry we  
 train 161 different Industries including  
 yours watching me in fact if we don't  
 train your industry you would never see  
 this video because we target people that  
 are in the industries R train right so  
 if you're watching this we already train  
 your industry okay so in this example  
 let's say you sell Financial Services to  
 a consumer it's already been booked in  
 by an SDR or maybe you co- call booked  
 in an appointment now you're meeting  
 them on Zoom okay hey John hey welcome  
 welcome to the car I'm a little bit  
 behind schedule can you hear me okay  
 yeah I can hear you okay and can you can  
 you see me if their videoos off yeah I  
 can't I can't see is your is your video  
 broken I'm kind of confused oh yeah  
 sorry most of the time they'll just  
 click on oh yeah I just had it off and  
 they click it on because they feel  
 almost embarrassed okay now there's more  
 to that okay but I'm showing you a  
 little bit here okay so looks like you  
 booked on the calendar about looking at  
 maybe some outside you know some some  
 possible help with your retirement  
 planning and 401K options to get maybe a  
 higher rate of return right okay if I'm  
 selling Financial Services I'm selling  
 the result of what that does help them  
 retire on time maybe protect their  
 principle and or get them a higher rate  
 of return depending on what you're doing  
 okay that's a way to start that okay let  
 me show you maybe one more here okay  
 because there's a lot of different  
 connection questions we're going to ask  
 let's say if you sold well yeah let's  
 just go back I'm going to show you a  
 couple more options there okay keep it  
 simple with here okay then I'm going to  
 go into my second connection question  
 okay so it looks like you spoke with my  
 associate Tiffany lus what was it that  
 you guys kind of discuss that cause you  
 to you know want to want to look into  
 this further well we were talking about  
 this and we were talking about that now  
 that gives you kind of an idea of what's  
 going on an overview and then I'm going  
 to go into what we call an npq status  
 frame where they know there could be  
 next steps after this conversation is  
 over if it fits into what they're  
 looking for nice casual non pressure but  
 in a way where they view you as more of  
 the expert the person they trust okay ah  
 okay yeah and I would say yeah I'm the  
 first part of this call it's pretty  
 basic it's really more for us to  
 understand kind of what you're doing now  
 to save for retirement and kind of the  
 results you've been getting from that  
 compared to maybe where you're wanting  
 that to be to kind of see what that Gap  
 looks like and then towards the end of  
 the call if you feel like hey this might  
 be what you're looking for we can kind  
 of go over some options and and talk  
 about possible neeps would that help you  
 if we did that for you yeah sure now  
 here's what I did why am I downplaying  
 it because my first job is what to get  
 them to let their guard down nice and  
 relaxed if I uplate I'm so excited to be  
 on here I'm going to show you something  
 great and at the end if you feel it's  
 what you're looking for and I feel  
 you're good fit for me I'll show you to  
 get started that's what a lot of  
 salespeople do triggers resistance  
 because they know what that means so I'm  
 downplaying now I'm not doing it in a  
 negative way yeah this Call's going to  
 suck it's horrible that's not what I  
 mean I'm more neutral first part of this  
 call it's pretty basic so I wanted I  
 want them to let their guard down  
 because if I can get them to let their  
 guard down they become more open to  
 answering the questions I'm asking  
 truthfully and going below the surface  
 it's really more for us to understand  
 watch my hands kind of what you're doing  
 now for retirement and kind of the  
 results you're getting from that look I  
 don't want to say results you're getting  
 from that here results you're getting  
 from that compared to maybe where you're  
 wanting them to be see I just visually  
 created a gap to see what that Gap looks  
 like visually I just created a gap even  
 if I'm on the phone am I still doing  
 that yes because my body language  
 affects my tonality if I don't move I  
 sound like a robot it's very hard to  
 talk okay then towards the end of the  
 call if you feel like hey this might be  
 why would these might be and possible  
 next steps because those are neutral  
 terms that's neutral languaging because  
 how much trust and credibility do I have  
 in the first one or two minutes of a  
 conversation not that much unless they  
 already trust to know me more than  
 likely they don't so I'm going to be far  
 more neutral in the beginning it's hard  
 for them to say no we canot talk about  
 possible next steps they they're not but  
 if I said hey towards the end of the  
 call if you're like hey this is what I'm  
 looking for I'll show you to get started  
 fair enough well that sounds good but  
 let's see what you got because I'm still  
 shopping around and you might trigger an  
 A type to give you a little resistance  
 now the Wall's up now you got to compete  
 against the wall I want to keep the wall  
 down if I say you feel like hey this  
 might be what you're looking for we can  
 talk about you know possible next steps  
 no one will ever say no we cannot talk  
 about possible next steps because it's  
 neutral okay see where I'm at okay now  
 those are a few examples of connection  
 questions now there's a lot more there  
 we have connection questions for every  
 industry including yours and our virtual  
 training programs for our clients if you  
 want no more details about that you can  
 always message us okay all right let's  
 go over to now that we've kind of got  
 them to let their guard down we're  
 getting them into results based thinking  
 over price or cost based thinking we now  
 want to understand what their real  
 situation is now let's go to npq  
 situation questions these are asked  
 right after your connection questions  
 and what this does it does two things  
 first of all it helps  
 you understand what the prospect's real  
 situation is okay why would you want to  
 know what the real situation is because  
 if you don't really understand what  
 their real situation is how are you  
 going to build a gap to where they want  
 to go if you don't really know where  
 they're at if you're guessing or if you  
 think that every Prospect situation is  
 the same you talk to that's a huge  
 mistake you'll lose tons of deals  
 because you don't really understand the  
 real situation so when you go into your  
 presentation you're presenting to  
 something that you don't even know  
 you're guessing you're throwing mud  
 against the wall hoping and praying  
 something you're going to say is going  
 to magically cause them to want to buy I  
 call that hoping it's a drug a lot of  
 salese take very hard and unpredictable  
 way to make a really big living as a  
 salesperson or scale your company or  
 grow it even if you're a Fortune 500  
 company now how are you going to  
 increase sales next year by 30% or 50%  
 growth because we've seen that happen  
 once you start to learn these type of  
 things in every industry okay now the  
 second thing it also does is it helps  
 your prospects this is most important  
 helps your prospect understand their  
 real situation cuz most of your  
 prospects you know this when you talk to  
 them first talk to them don't really  
 understand their real situation who was  
 it that said Steve Jobs said that most  
 consumers don't really know what they  
 need that's valid they might have an  
 idea of their problems but they don't  
 understand the depth of those problems  
 they don't understand how bad those  
 problems really are they don't  
 especially understand what the  
 consequences are if they don't do  
 anything about solving those problems  
 okay so this is helping us understand  
 the real situation helping them  
 understand cuz if we can't help them  
 understand the real situation how are  
 you going to build a gap to where they  
 want to go if the prospect doesn't even  
 really understand where they're at very  
 hard to do okay you don't want to do  
 that you just lose sales you could be  
 making all right now these are some  
 generic situation questions it depends  
 on your industry we're finding out more  
 about what they're doing now for XYZ  
 like I said this is all going to be  
 tweaked based on the industry what are  
 they using now how long what got them  
 involved with it what does their process  
 look like depending on what you sell how  
 many do they have what are you doing now  
 too like I said not going to ask all of  
 these these are just different generic  
 starts to situation questions based on  
 your industry B Toc B2B okay um it could  
 be what type of blank do you have now so  
 I understand how many okay you're blank  
 can you tell me a little bit more about  
 that there's many different versions  
 here okay um you mention your  
 application you're having some issues  
 with blank can you go over that with me  
 can you help me understand what are you  
 doing now to blank so I have have more  
 background like I said depending on your  
 industry would be depend on how we tweak  
 these generic versions now let me show  
 you a few different industry specific  
 examples let's say if you sell health  
 insurance huge industry we train uh we  
 train several large divisions of United  
 healthc care now uh second largest  
 health insurance provider TR several  
 divisions they're crushing it so I so  
 this is after the connection questions  
 okay so what kind of coverage do you  
 have now just so I understand oh we have  
 this we have that ah what are they  
 making you pay every month for that type  
 of  
 coverage okay and what are what are they  
 making you pay every month even if I'm  
 on the phone now why would I say what  
 are they making you pay so if they  
 already have a health plan do I want to  
 position myself against what they  
 already have with a different compy oh  
 okay what are they what are they making  
 you pay every month with that coverage  
 making you pay and look at my did you  
 hear my tonality my tone just sounded  
 what like I'm a little bit skeptical by  
 I I might know something about that  
 company or plan they don't no I'm not  
 saying anything negative cuz that's  
 going to get them defensive but my tone  
 implies I know something bad about that  
 I'm just not saying okay it's a whole  
 different ball game what I'm doing is  
 I'm seating doubt in the prospect's mind  
 that they might be overpaying that but  
 they might not be on the right plan all  
 by using my toneal I can show you a  
 billion examples of that okay how long  
 have you had the plan  
 for okay yeah and I asked because that's  
 a I mean that's a fairly decent policy I  
 mean we don't typically see a family of  
 your size in that policy though what  
 caused you to go with that one over  
 something else though now what did I  
 just do what did I just seed yeah I mean  
 that's a that's a fairly decent policy  
 now why would I say fairly decent I  
 don't want to say that's a great policy  
 and I want to say that's a horrible  
 policy great policy reinforces they  
 should stay with it if I say that's a  
 horrible policy and here's why unless  
 they're laid down most of them will not  
 they'll get defensive because then  
 you're trying to sell them something I  
 mean that's a fairly decent policy see  
 what did my tone just communicate more  
 doubt I'm seeding doubt that I might  
 know something about the policy that's  
 not that good and then I'm saying yeah  
 we just we typically don't see a family  
 of your size we typically don't see  
 someone your age in that policy what  
 caused you to go with that one over  
 something else though causing in doubt  
 seeding doubt that they might not be on  
 the policy then we're going to verify  
 health information here okay we're going  
 to show you how to do it that in a  
 playful tone now I'm just I'm not going  
 to show you all of this here because  
 we're going to be here for 10 years if I  
 showed you 161 different Industries  
 train you know how many Industries there  
 are in the world only 163 according to  
 Forbes Magazine there's subcategories of  
 each one we train 161 of those including  
 yours and all the subcategories let's  
 see if you sold employee benefits Big  
 Industry Force okay ah okay and about  
 how many employees do you have on your  
 your health benefits plan okay how many  
 total members okay okay and what what  
 carry do you currently use for health  
 and employee benefits just so I have  
 kind of a background there okay and are  
 they fully insured or  
 self-insured oh okay how long have you  
 been with them for M and what type of  
 plan did they put you on now I'm letting  
 them answer all these things oh yeah I'm  
 surprised they'd put you on that plan I  
 mean companies of your size we rarely  
 see them on that plan what caused you to  
 go with that plan over something else  
 just so I have more understanding see  
 once again I'm seeding doubt okay now  
 why what am I seating doubt about now  
 the I didn't go over this situation  
 questions are more factual questions  
 you're getting the facts about their  
 situation not as much of the pain yet  
 but I can start seeding pain using my  
 tone see how I did it here yeah I'm I'm  
 really surprised they put you on that  
 plan I mean companies of your size we  
 rarely see them on that plan what caused  
 you to go with that plan over over  
 something else just so I know I'm  
 seating out they might be on the wrong  
 plan now let's say that you find out  
 from your situation questions that one  
 of their problems are is they're losing  
 a lot of their top Executives to their  
 competitors who are offering better  
 benefit packages okay so this industry  
 kind of solves that okay and other  
 things uh let's go to a couple more here  
 I'm just showing you a few examples  
 let's say I'm literally going to show  
 you any industry in the world let's say  
 if you sell certifications to become a  
 builder in some countries you have to  
 get certified to become a general  
 contractor and you have to go through  
 courses you have to buy like it's like  
 schooling okay so let's say you sell in  
 the education industry okay so what what  
 do you do for work what do you do for a  
 living now oh I'm in uh you know I'm a  
 carpenter ah okay are you working for  
 yourself or having to work for someone  
 else see if I'm selling certifications  
 so they become a builder that means when  
 they become a builder they start their  
 own business as a builder so what am I  
 going to see doubt about working for  
 someone else compared to working for  
 themselves see what I just did there oh  
 you're stting to work for someone else  
 then how long have you been having to do  
 that  
 okay and how many hours are they making  
 you work every week see making you so  
 I'm positioning myself that I can help  
 them by them getting certified to learn  
 how to do this so in your mind what are  
 you hoping would happen by getting  
 certified as a builder though I'm hoping  
 it would do this it would do that see  
 what we're doing there I'll give you one  
 more example here let's say if you sold  
 Home Improvement and you did cabinets  
 this is a huge industry for us I think I  
 want to say the fifth sixth maybe seven  
 largest industry could be cabinets doors  
 windows awnings sidings carpeting  
 countertops you know gutters leaf  
 filters I mean anything that's Home  
 Improvement Home Services huge industry  
 R Trin one of the like I said top five  
 to seven biggest industries so if I  
 can't see I'm seeing selling cabinets  
 and if I can't see the cabinets from  
 where I'm sitting with them I might say  
 okay what what type of cabinets do you  
 have now so I have more understanding or  
 countertops whatever you're selling okay  
 can you show me those just just so I so  
 I can see that okay then I'm walking  
 into the kitchen oh so you have the the  
 oh so you have the blank ones oh so you  
 have kind of the older mahogany looking  
 ones oh so you have the kind of older  
 like kind of the thick oak on from like  
 the the late 80s 90s okay so I'm seeding  
 doubt with my tone okay I'm not being  
 negative but I'm see how long have you  
 had those in there okay were they there  
 when you moved in or did you have them  
 installed now if they have them  
 installed yeah we  
 typically gosh I mean those are fairly  
 decent we just typically don't see this  
 type of C CET and a house as as nice as  
 big as yours what caused you to have  
 that type installed just so I have more  
 understanding so I'm showing empathy I'm  
 not making fun of them yeah I asked  
 because we typically don't see that type  
 of cabinet in a house as big as yours  
 what caus you to have those put in 10  
 years ago just so I have more  
 understanding okay I want that  
 understanding I want to understand their  
 situation and I want them to understand  
 it let's say if I'm in the kitchen when  
 you start now looking at your cabinets  
 are those the stick built cabinets or  
 they more manufactured okay were they  
 here when you moved in or you have them  
 installed okay and how long have you  
 have those in those are situation  
 questions then I'm going to move in okay  
 into my problem awareness which I'm  
 going to show you next I mean Amy I mean  
 these are fairly decent I mean what's  
 causing you to feel like you might want  
 to replace them though now why did I ask  
 that I mean these are fairly decent  
 cabinets what's caus you to feel like  
 you might want to replace them now what  
 does this do right here this causes them  
 to defend themselves on what why they  
 want to change is that what you want  
 them to do rather than you telling them  
 why they should change which is more  
 persuasive if they tell you and get  
 defensive on why they want to change  
 compared to you telling them why they  
 should change see I want to trigger that  
 emotional driver in their brain that  
 causes them to tell me and themselves  
 why they have to change their situation  
 whole lot more to that that's just kind  
 of an overview okay let's go into  
 problem awareness questions here I just  
 showed you one right they're mainly  
 situation questions all right now I'm  
 going to show you problem awareness  
 questions now they do a couple things  
 problem awareness questions help you  
 build the Gap from where the prospect is  
 we call that their current state to  
 where they want to be now we call that  
 their objective State current state  
 here's where they are current situation  
 objective State here's where they want  
 to be here's what the future looks like  
 when the new found problems are solved  
 they also do this they help you and them  
 find out what their real problems are  
 not the surface problems what are the  
 root causes of the problem okay have you  
 ever found out what's the root cause of  
 those problems because most sales people  
 don't even know how to ask that to get  
 them to open up and get them to realize  
 there is a root cause of each of their  
 problems and most importantly we're  
 finding out how those problems are  
 affecting them even personally even if  
 you're talking to a Fortune 100 company  
 and they're a department head how are  
 the problems affecting them personally  
 not just as a department or a business  
 or if they're a consumer how it's  
 affecting them personally okay now I'm  
 going to give you a few examples uh well  
 let's go back here we were just on  
 health insurance I'll just show you an  
 example so I mean you've been on XYZ  
 plan the last two years it's it's not a  
 a bad plan I mean what's caused you to  
 feel like you might want something  
 different same thing now I'm getting  
 them to defend themselves on why they  
 want something different okay ah okay  
 what else would you change though if you  
 could that's a probing question  
 depending on their answer okay so is  
 this your ideal coverage or would you  
 rather have something possibly better if  
 you could depending on how they answer  
 these questions might change okay or  
 let's say so when you've gone to the  
 doctor and use that policy did you like  
 how they covered you now it depends on  
 how they answer their situation  
 questions if I'm going to ask this  
 question or this question or even that  
 first question up here I'm basing that  
 based off their answers for my  
 connection and situation questions now  
 train a lot more of that in our virtual  
 training portals than obviously a free  
 YouTube video so when you get ready to  
 go to the doctor do you pick whoever you  
 want to go to or are you like forced to  
 only use the doctors on the company's  
 list oh so they're making you go just to  
 the doctors on their list though see  
 like if I'm selling a policy that covers  
 out of network coverage this is going to  
 be a question that I'm going to seed in  
 their mind or are they just forcing you  
 forcing you see that's nobody in America  
 or anywhere in the world likes to be  
 forced or made to do anything okay so  
 that's just an example there's a lot  
 more to this we don't really have time  
 to go through right now okay we're  
 obviously going to clarify we're going  
 to probe off different questions and  
 answers they give us okay so let's go to  
 a different industry here I'm going to  
 show you just a couple of examples here  
 on each one and like I said if you want  
 to know more industry specific uh  
 questions and tonality for your industry  
 just reach out to us okay let's say  
 you're a marketing agency okay uh and  
 you're selling leads to companies so I  
 mean what's making you feel like the  
 leads you're getting from XYZ vendor  
 aren't enough to really scale your  
 business so I mean the vendor you're  
 using I mean they're fairly decent I  
 mean what's caused you to feel like  
 those leads aren't going to be good  
 enough to really scale the business to  
 $10 million a month if they said they  
 want to scale to 10 million a month and  
 they're only at 7 million a month I'm  
 just plugging in what they said okay or  
 the first problem or question I could  
 asked so do you  
 like results you've been getting now  
 even if they say yes oh what do you like  
 what do you enjoy oh I like this I like  
 that then I can say I mean it sounds  
 like it sounds like things are going  
 100% perfect for you what would you  
 change if you could well I mean I  
 wouldn't say they're 100% perfect not  
 100% well yeah we don't like now why  
 would I say sounds like things are 100%  
 why not say sounds like things are  
 perfect why would I put in 100% do you  
 know why because psychologically humans  
 do not like 100% of anything they have  
 think about the thing your your favorite  
 car that you bought a year ago you love  
 that car you were so excited and then 6  
 months later was there something you  
 didn't like think about the person  
 you're dating now when you first dating  
 them a couple months perfect as an angel  
 they didn't know wrong six months later  
 there's something you didn't like yeah  
 of course right and probably something  
 they don't like about you see we're  
 human beings we don't like a 100% of  
 anything so it's hard for them to say  
 yep I like 100% so I mean it sounds like  
 things are 100% perfect for you guys  
 over there would you what would you  
 change if you could well I mean don't  
 get me wrong I would say it's 100% not  
 100% see the hand the concern not 100%  
 well yeah we like but we also okay and  
 they start to expand on their pain and  
 tell me what they don't like okay those  
 are just a couple of different examples  
 I'll give you one more industry specific  
 now there's more questions after that  
 just want you to know but I'm just  
 giving you a few examples  
 okay this just kind let's say you sold  
 sass to trucking companies to help them  
 weed out bad recruits flaky recruits  
 that sometimes get hired from indeed or  
 LinkedIn they get uh their license they  
 show up to work they go on the road for  
 two weeks and then they quit and where  
 does all that merchandise set in the  
 trucking parking lot collecting dust and  
 they're losing tens of thousands of  
 dollars a day because it's not being  
 delivered this solves that for them and  
 automates it and weeds out the bad ones  
 so I mean you've been advertising on  
 indeed for the past three years do you  
 do you  
 like The Hires you've been getting I'm  
 saying that in a skeptical tone I'm  
 verbal pausing here do you  
 like the candidates it's been getting  
 you see I'm concerned my tone sounds  
 concerned and it sounds skeptical write  
 this down your tone is how the prospect  
 interprets every question you ask him  
 that's how they interpret your intention  
 behind the questions you're asking them  
 so they feel like I'm concerned and I'm  
 concerned about these results because I  
 know something about it that they might  
 not know they it causes them to trust me  
 more because I'm I'm using a concern  
 tone in this context you're not use a  
 concern tone in every question but in  
 this context it makes sense okay or I  
 might say so you've been using indeed  
 the last few years I mean what what  
 makes you feel like that's not going to  
 be enough to really get the right people  
 for you well don't give me wrong wrong  
 we like it but and then they start  
 telling you what they don't like but  
 more importantly they tell themselves  
 okay now there's a lot more problem wor  
 questions to ask I'm just giving you  
 kind of an overview here in this YouTube  
 video and one thing I would suggest if  
 you want to learn a lot more about NQ  
 and you subscribe to this channel I  
 would suggest don't share it with your  
 competition because if you share it with  
 your competitors even if they're a  
 friend and they start learning what I  
 show you on this YouTube channel you  
 probably don't want them to get get much  
 better at selling so if you're going to  
 share this channel And subscribe to it  
 make sure you send it to friends or  
 people you know who are not competing  
 with you maybe a different industry or  
 something just a word of advice there  
 okay all right let's go into solution  
 awareness questions okay now solution  
 awareness questions first of all they do  
 two things the first half of solution is  
 they're finding out what have they done  
 in the past to change their situation  
 more importantly what have they done in  
 the past to solve the new found problems  
 that we just our questions allowed them  
 start to see they have that they may not  
 have they might not even know they had  
 those before you start so what what have  
 they pass about solving these new found  
 problems they didn't even realize they  
 had gets them to question their way of  
 thinking and why they've allowed the  
 problems to keep happening the second  
 thing it does is what does the future  
 look like once the new found problems  
 are solved so I'm going to give you a  
 few examples of the first half and then  
 the second half okay uh let's go  
 here uh okay those are some generic  
 examples here let's show you some few  
 industry let's say if you sell let's say  
 if you're an investor and you're calling  
 distress properties this is a huge  
 industry train real estate's the second  
 largest industry train in the world that  
 means residential agents uh commercial  
 agents and then investors who call  
 distress properties huge industry Force  
 so before we started talking were you  
 guys out there looking for options to  
 sell your home so it didn't go into  
 foreclosure or or what were you doing to  
 get rid of the property so it didn't  
 hurt your credit if that was the problem  
 maybe they went through divorce they  
 can't make the payment now now cuz one  
 spouse left and they're back okay now if  
 they say no we haven't done anything oh  
 what what held you back from doing that  
 in the last few months gets them to  
 question what's held them back if they  
 say yes oh okay so you listed it with  
 let's say they said they listed with the  
 realtor but it didn't sell so what do  
 you feel really held the realtor back  
 from being able to sell it for you  
 though now why would I want to find that  
 out because maybe maybe they you know  
 they start because I want to prevent  
 them from saying I'm going to relist it  
 with a different real estate agent maybe  
 they I want them to believe that that  
 agent's not going to be able to really  
 sell it sell it for them at the price  
 they want or even close obviously I'm an  
 investor I'm going to buy it a lot  
 cheaper than maybe what the market value  
 is okay or let's say they talk with  
 another investor oh what prevented you  
 from going with that investor now if  
 you're an investor why would you want to  
 know what prevented them from going to  
 other investors because it helps you  
 understand what they don't like it helps  
 you understand what they're willing to  
 accept and if you if if they're like  
 well we didn't go with them because they  
 gave us a lob offer oh what did they  
 offer you and then you find out you're  
 going to offer them the same thing now  
 you know you're going to have to handle  
 you're going to help actually have to  
 prevent that objection from happening  
 okay and I can show you how to do that  
 in some other trainings all right um now  
 there's other questions there but that's  
 kind of a an example of finding out what  
 they've done in the past okay and what  
 are you hoping to get out of the home if  
 if we were able to buy like what would  
 be your price range and and what do you  
 really want to get a home let's say  
 they're like oh I want to get 250,000  
 just making up a number now you know the  
 home's not worth 2 50 you know that  
 you're probably going to only offer 180  
 let's just say that cuz you got to  
 repair it flip it and you know you want  
 to sell it for 280 okay and you're going  
 to have to put 40 Grand in I'm just  
 making something up okay now if I this  
 is a pricing now if I go to my  
 partners and let's say they give me a  
 number lower than that I mean I don't  
 even know I I have to see let's say they  
 only going to give you like 210 or 200  
 or even like 190 or or or less did I  
 just go tell them to go kick rocks and  
 pound sand we can't do anything together  
 what do you feel like we should do now  
 this question is not going to work if  
 you ask him that in the first 2 minutes  
 because you haven't built any emotional  
 Gap from where they are to where they  
 want to be you get three4 of the  
 conversation you build an emotional Gap  
 and you got them to emotional up this  
 works wonders because what they'll do is  
 like well just see what they offer and  
 then we'll kind of decide what we're  
 going to do and now what did I just SE  
 in their brain that they're probably  
 going to get a much lower offer than  
 what they originally thought they had so  
 when I go back the next day or let's say  
 if I go to my car run some numbers come  
 back in 15 minutes when I offer them  
 that lower number it's way less sticker  
 shock than what you're getting now  
 that's kind of a tweak for that industry  
 okay other Industries you wouldn't use  
 that at all let's say if you sold ILS  
 index universal life okay I'll show you  
 so before today were you at looking for  
 like more stable options so you can  
 retire you know by 62 or what have you  
 been doing and I'm going to repeat back  
 what they said retire by 62 okay  
 okay let's say if they say no oh what  
 what held you back from doing that or  
 what prevented you from looking at other  
 strategies in the past if they said yes  
 okay and how how has that strategy  
 worked out for you so far or what type  
 of results did you get with that it  
 depends on their answer would depend on  
 the question I'm going to ask next okay  
 once again we're finding out what have  
 they done in the past about solving  
 those problems now let's go to let's say  
 you know I can show you every industry  
 here on the planet dental implants CRM  
 and I can show you everything here let's  
 go to another industry here and there's  
 more solution awareness questions you  
 have to ask after that I'm just going to  
 give you in a brief overview okay  
 medical device huge one so before today  
 were you out there looking for you know  
 other techniques that would reduce your  
 operating time so you can do more cases  
 or or what have you been doing okay if  
 they said no oh what held you back from  
 doing that in the past if they said yes  
 oh what were you actually looking at  
 what held you back with going with that  
 system okay I can find that out okay now  
 there's other things I'm going to do  
 after that okay medical device huge  
 industry ret Trin car dealerships let's  
 go to a different one here weight loss I  
 mean I could show you everything here  
 okay um now let's go to a few different  
 examples of the second half of solution  
 awareness questions okay now let's show  
 you what the future looks like once the  
 new found problems are solved let's say  
 that you are a recruiter you sell for a  
 staffing agency huge industry ret train  
 as well so let's say that we're able to  
 to find you the candidate with that  
 Talent unique talent of like managing a  
 Salesforce of 250 people I me that's a  
 lot of people we do this like we do  
 through other clients having that  
 manager in place right now how do you  
 see that benefiting you the most so oh  
 it benefit me because of this because of  
 that because of this see they're telling  
 themselves how that would benefit them  
 then I'm going to say okay but on your  
 end what would it do for you let's say  
 personally and you lower your tone into  
 that concern tone okay now this this is  
 three4 the way in the conversation after  
 you build an emotional Gap they have  
 emotionally opened up to you okay you're  
 not going to ask these questions in the  
 first 2 minutes when you have no trust  
 when there's no Gap yet okay but how  
 would it be different though you being  
 able to spend that time with your family  
 not having to work that extra four hours  
 a day trying to manage all these people  
 filling in how would your life  
 be how would it be different maybe than  
 it is now see and I'm concerned I have a  
 concerned tone a tone that shows empathy  
 now I'm on repeating back what that  
 Prospect said he said I have to work an  
 extra 2 to four hours a day to fill in  
 for that management spot cuz we haven't  
 found the right person I'm just going to  
 plug that in that causes the prospect to  
 feel like you understand their unique  
 situation the most prospects always go  
 with the company or salesperson they  
 feel understands their unique situation  
 the most okay let's say if you sell uh  
 your personal trainer you sell weight  
 loss or you Fitness or building more  
 muscle or losing more weight okay and  
 let's say this Prospect says they want  
 to lose 105 lb okay so let's say that we  
 come in and we're able to help you lose  
 the 105 lbs and more importantly keep it  
 off for it doesn't come back what would  
 you be able to do that you feel you  
 can't do right now or can't do at your  
 best right now oh gosh I'd be able to  
 play basketball my son I'd rather I'd be  
 able to go jogging like I used to I'd be  
 able to do this I'd be able to do that  
 okay now they're telling themselves what  
 what the future looks like for them what  
 once the problem is solved losing the  
 105 lbs okay but being able to do that  
 what would that do for you what would it  
 do for you personally oh would do this  
 now this is where the emotion comes out  
 okay this is logical I'd be able to hike  
 I'd be able to play basketball and Sun  
 I'd be able to work out that's logical  
 things they said it would do now I need  
 to open them up more emotionally okay  
 remember human beings make decisions  
 logically or emotionally 100% emotion  
 brain studies prove that there's no  
 doubt among Behavior scientists how' it  
 be different though I mean you've been  
 able to lose the 105 PBS and most  
 importantly keep it off or it doesn't  
 come back how do you see your life being  
 I don't know maybe maybe different than  
 it is now okay now a lot more examples I  
 can show you for every industry for  
 solution wearen questions all right  
 let's now look at neq consequence  
 questions all right I'll give you a few  
 examples different Industries as well so  
 consequence questions really do two  
 things first of all they help your  
 process prect they actually get your  
 prospect to defend themselves on why  
 they need to make the change why they  
 need to buy from you okay I'll show you  
 what I mean by that because you're not  
 going to ask a consequence question the  
 first couple of minutes of a  
 conversation because you haven't built a  
 gap yet you haven't built a gap from  
 where they are to where they want to be  
 you haven't helped them find problems  
 yet they might not have known they had  
 after I've done that and emotionally  
 open them up I then can ask consequence  
 questions where they defend themselves  
 on why they need to change I show a few  
 different industry specific examples  
 okay they also get them to question  
 their way of thinking that's allowed the  
 problems to keep happening all right so  
 give a few generic versions okay these  
 are generic okay don't say these word  
 for word because you don't want to use  
 generic terms you don't ask generalized  
 questions because you're going to get  
 generalized generic vague answers back  
 from your prospects that's not what you  
 want okay what if you don't do anything  
 about this problem and it actually gets  
 worse now you're not going to say  
 problem you're going to say what the  
 problem is what if you don't do anything  
 about you know this lowquality lead flow  
 you're getting from vendor X and your  
 sales keep going down every month see  
 that would be specific if I was a  
 marketing agency talking to a company so  
 you're going to repeat the problem and  
 you're going to repeat what the real  
 situation is you're not going to use  
 those generic terms now notice I started  
 off in a challenging tone what if you  
 don't do anything about this and the  
 situation gets worse okay start with a  
 challenging tone I'm want to trigger  
 their emotion to defend themselves and  
 then I'm going to lower my tone at the  
 very end into that concern tone a tone  
 that shows empathy remember your tone is  
 how the prospect interprets your  
 intention behind every question you ask  
 here's another J have you thought about  
 what would happen if your company  
 doesn't do anything about this or what  
 are the ramifications if this doesn't  
 actually change now once again those are  
 all generic you'd want to plug in the  
 situation not the SA the word situation  
 okay so let me show you just a few  
 different industry specific examples so  
 you can get kind of an idea now let's  
 say you sell dental implants huge  
 industry we train we train one coming to  
 700 million plus this what happens if  
 you don't do anything about this and you  
 keep losing the bone Den in your jaw and  
 now you can't even get the implants so  
 I'm going to start off challenging okay  
 let me show you that again I'm starting  
 off the challenging tone I'm going to  
 end it with a concern tone a tone that  
 shows empathy okay what happens John and  
 on the flip side because you certainly  
 sound motivated but what happens if you  
 don't do anything about this and you  
 keep losing the bone density in your jaw  
 now you can't even get the implants see  
 I'm concerned for you the consequence I  
 start off challenging trigger their  
 emotion gets them to defend themselves  
 and then I lower my tone in the  
 concerned tone so they know I'm  
 concerned for the consequence of that  
 happening okay uh let's see give you  
 another example here uh well let's say  
 they said this well I don't know I I  
 just hope that won't happen right they  
 could say that okay depending on how  
 your tone right then I might say well I  
 mean do you want to have to keep living  
 with that pain in your mouth if you if  
 you didn't have to well no if I didn't  
 have to see that's a way to open up now  
 let me get another example let's say if  
 you sell employee benefits okay B2B and  
 you're the problem that this company has  
 is they're losing some of their top  
 people employees to competitor X that is  
 offering them a better benefit package  
 so you can solve that problem for them  
 that attrition okay but on the flip side  
 what happens if you guys just keep the  
 same plan and your top people keep going  
 over to XYZ competitor I mean what  
 happens to the business at that point  
 see challenging to then concerned okay  
 all right now there's different nuances  
 you're going to say because most of the  
 time you use the right tone and you've  
 built a gap before they're like oh no we  
 need to change definitely we need to  
 Well you certainly sound motivated but  
 why look at doing this now I mean why  
 not push it down the road like a lot of  
 companies do who end up going under okay  
 if that's the case if that's the context  
 all right uh okay here's one right here  
 marketing agency let's say you're  
 talking to a real estate agent that  
 needs a higher quality lead because they  
 not getting that many listings without  
 listings they don't make any sales okay  
 what if you don't I mean John you  
 certainly sound motivated so after I  
 asked my last solution awareness  
 question so consequence comes after your  
 last solution ress question that's when  
 I got them to see and fill with the  
 future looks like once the new found  
 problems are solved so they're on a high  
 emotional state I'm then they going to  
 transition I mean you certainly sound  
 motivated but what if you don't do  
 anything about this and you keep getting  
 these lower quality leads like you said  
 that don't even pick up when you call I  
 mean what are the consequences for your  
 department at that point see now I'm  
 concerned challenging you concerned okay  
 me you want to have to go through all  
 that if you if you didn't have to you'd  
 only say that if they respond to well I  
 don't know I'd have to figure something  
 out that is a way to reloop and reframe  
 that way of thinking right there okay uh  
 how about a car dealership what happens  
 if you just keep this car and it keeps  
 breaking down on your way to work I mean  
 what would happen to your job at that  
 point and let's say their problem was  
 they have a used car it's broken down  
 three times in the last four months and  
 they're afraid that their boss is going  
 to fire them because they keep getting  
 late at work okay I could show you 50  
 gazillion other examples for every  
 indust let's say if you sold solar okay  
 same want Big Industry trainers what  
 happens if you don't do anything about  
 this and Edison I mean they keep raising  
 your rates every year like they always  
 have but now you 25 years you're 75 80  
 years old so having to pay the bill  
 every month where's the bill going to be  
 then yeah probably three or four times  
 higher but now you're retired so you're  
 on a yeah like a limited income I mean  
 with the bill that high in a limited  
 income how would you guys pay for it at  
 that point you're concerned they  
 challenging to concern now what I just  
 did here that's a long question anytime  
 you have a long question you really have  
 to verbal Pace it out with lots of  
 verbal pauses because if you say it too  
 fast what happens if you don't do  
 anything about this they keep raising  
 rates every year like they have and now  
 you're 75 still having to pay the bill  
 every month but the bill is more than  
 three times high as now and now you're  
 all income how would you pay for it oh I  
 don't know i' figure something out see  
 one of the biggest reasons why you get  
 so many of your prospects that give you  
 vague General surface level answers is  
 you haven't learned how to verbal Pace  
 them out and when you ask them too fast  
 you give the prospect no time to  
 internalize and think deeper about the  
 question you asked when I Pace it out  
 you keep them engaged because they're  
 hanging on to every word and it causes  
 their brain to literally think deeper  
 about what you just asked it makes it  
 more emotional to them okay now there's  
 other things you're going to say  
 depending on what they say and how they  
 ask let's say if you sold cyber security  
 Big Industry Force so if you continue to  
 use XYZ vendor what are the  
 consequences if this doesn't change with  
 your false positive rates and you  
 continue rejecting good customers for  
 the  
 bank okay depending on what they say I'm  
 going to plug that in okay let me see if  
 I can give you one more here uh let's go  
 oh okay let give a complete different  
 example let's say that you're a  
 therapist and you're trying to get more  
 clients and you're a marriage therapist  
 I go this so what if you don't do  
 anything about this and you keep having  
 these issues with your husband where  
 you're arguing and feeling all this  
 resentment and it keeps going on in  
 another three 6 12 months I mean what  
 would happen to the marriage at that  
 point okay gets them to internalize that  
 okay what or I could just lean in and  
 say what happens to your marriage if you  
 don't do anything about this what  
 happens to your marriage if you don't do  
 anything about this see soft tone  
 concern tone okay all right now those  
 are just a few examples you want  
 industry specific examples for your  
 industry just message us maybe you can  
 get into our Advanced training programs  
 that's where we train you all that all  
 the nuances okay we're now going to go  
 into I'm not really going to go into  
 presentations you know we'll save that  
 for another training but after we  
 transition so right now at this point  
 we're going to transition into one or  
 two things okay if you sell B Toc  
 business to Consumer and you're in a one  
 call close Okay so there's lots of  
 industries that you just close the first  
 time you talk to them you're just going  
 to Simply trans transition into your  
 presentation and then you're going to  
 ask commitment questions to close in you  
 could be in a b2c industry where it's a  
 two call close let's say if you sold  
 pools for example and you have a first  
 call Discovery second call uh proposal  
 okay could be a second call so you would  
 transition into setting up the second  
 call you could be in SAS where maybe  
 your second appointment is the next step  
 demo you could be in some type of  
 Enterprise level uh sales environment  
 where your average sales cycle is 9 to  
 12 months so whatever you're doing  
 you're transitioning into the next step  
 of your process you're not just saying  
 okay well get back to me I'll call you  
 next week with a proposal that's not  
 going to work you have to have something  
 scheduled on the calendar with that  
 Prospect Andor company depending on what  
 you sell otherwise you have nothing so  
 if you're in one call close you're going  
 to transition into the presentation and  
 then close them if you're in two CLS or  
 more you're going to transition into  
 whatever the next step is of your sales  
 process could be next step department  
 head meeting next step meeting with  
 legal next step meeting with another  
 decision maker next step meeting with a  
 proposal it just depends on what you  
 sell so after the presentation whether  
 you did the presentation on the first  
 appointment or call or whatever you s if  
 you're in a one call close situation or  
 if it's in a two call three call close  
 or I mean it like I said this could be  
 virtual at the home could be in their  
 office depending on if you sell business  
 to consumer or business to business  
 wherever you're at at the end of the  
 presentation proposal whatever this is  
 where you're going to commit them to  
 take the next step and purchase what  
 you're offering now there's two forms of  
 commitment I don't like to use the word  
 closing I feel like it demeans people  
 nobody likes to be closed you're okay  
 being committed to get your problem  
 solved and get where you're want right  
 it's a different way of thinking so the  
 first way of commitments are what we  
 call Micro commitments okay now micro  
 commitment let me show you this is where  
 you commit them to take smaller steps  
 that lead to the larger step to purchase  
 what you're offering and that's if  
 you're in a more than a one call close  
 when I say call I don't mean on the  
 phone could be on Zoom could be on the  
 phone could be at their home if it's a  
 consumer could be at their company if  
 it's a business could be at the door it  
 just depends okay so whatever the next  
 step is you're getting them to make a  
 micro commitment Next Step demo next  
 step meeting next step proposal whatever  
 it is that's one form of commitment the  
 other form of commitment questions use  
 is where we're going to commit them to  
 take the next step and purchase what  
 you're offering okay now this is generic  
 but you can pretty much use this in  
 pretty much every industry I can lean in  
 and say after I've brought up the  
 pricing all that stuff the different  
 options whatever they have depending on  
 what I sell so this is after I brought  
 up the pricing funding they need all  
 that stuff I can lean and say do you  
 feel like this could be the answer for  
 you now notice why did I say  
 feel why not say think feel is emotional  
 I'm keeping them on their emotional side  
 of their brain think is logical remember  
 human beings make buy decisions  
 emotionally or logically emotionally  
 100% brain studies prove this there's no  
 debate among science on this okay so I  
 use the word feel if I start to say do  
 you think this could be answer I just  
 took their brain from emotional side of  
 the brain to logical side of the brain  
 then I'm going to get more think it over  
 objections do more research objections  
 more cautiousness so I want to keep them  
 on the do you feel like this could be  
 the answer for you notice that verbal  
 pause there don't say it too fast okay  
 then you're going to get one or two  
 responses nobody's going to be like nope  
 this is not what I'm looking for they're  
 not going to go this far if that's the  
 case they're either going to say I  
 really do or they're going to say I do  
 but and they're going to tell you their  
 concern and that's what you want that's  
 why I put this question here to cause  
 them to either say yes I do or yes I do  
 but and they're going to tell but I  
 don't have the money but I'm not sure  
 it's going to work for this and at least  
 they start to tell me what the real  
 concern is you feel like this could be  
 the answer for you yeah we do well hold  
 on why do you feel like it is so well we  
 like this because of this because of  
 that because of this and they start  
 telling you why they feel it's what  
 they're looking for but more importantly  
 who are they telling they're telling  
 themselves see I'm always getting you're  
 always learning how to get the prospect  
 to sell themselves not you sell them  
 okay way easier if you learn how to sell  
 get them to sell themselves then you  
 trying to do it I will tell you your  
 prospects are far more persuasive when  
 they are selling themselves on why they  
 need to buy from you then you trying to  
 convince them yourself I can tell you  
 it's a 10 to one difference in  
 Persuasion ability and then I might ask  
 a second commitment question so what  
 specific aspects of what we've covered  
 do you feel like are really going to  
 help you the most and they start to tell  
 themselves and then basically you're  
 just telling them what the next step is  
 well I don't really have anything else  
 to go over with you it looks like we  
 covered the basis of what you're looking  
 for in XYZ really The Next Step would be  
 you tell them what the next step is you  
 know we can make some type of  
 arrangement for your XYZ you can use  
 debit card credit card dep on what you  
 sell you can send you an invoice it all  
 depends on your industry and then at the  
 very end I'm saying would that be  
 appropriate or would that be appropriate  
 or how do you want to proceed from here  
 I would stick to would that be  
 appropriate at the very beginning let me  
 give you one or two different industry  
 specific examples so you can see this  
 you're going to see this it's very  
 similar let's say if I'm selling B2B and  
 I'm selling business Consulting to help  
 build culture and large organizations  
 it's a big in of training as well do you  
 feel like this could be the answer for  
 you guys yeah yeah I feel like well hold  
 on why do you why do you feel like it is  
 though I'm kind of like pushing them  
 well hold on why do you feel like it is  
 well we like it because of this because  
 of that but what specific aspects of  
 what we've covered do you guys feel are  
 are really going to help you retain your  
 top Executives the most so because if  
 that is the problem I'm solving the  
 major problem that they had is they're  
 losing their top people because it's a  
 bad culture I'm solving that  
 with better culture training okay all  
 right then I could say well well I like  
 this I like that then I can push away if  
 I want to and I say well for you guys  
 why look at doing this now I me you  
 certainly sound vated but why not just  
 push it down the road like a lot of  
 companies do who end up losing a lot of  
 their best people well the reason why we  
 have to do it now is and they start  
 telling you why they have to do it now  
 but more importantly they're telling  
 themselves and they are far more  
 persuasive than you telling them that  
 now can I ask this question in the first  
 5 minutes of a conversation no cuz I  
 haven't built trust credibility or a gap  
 but I can at the very end of that sales  
 process very easily let me show you one  
 more example here uh okay let's say you  
 sell final expense Insurance okay or  
 life insurance this is the biggest  
 industry we train in the world okay uh  
 now let's say you've given them three  
 different policy options let's say a 10K  
 funeral 20K funeral and a 30k funeral  
 okay different life insurance options  
 for final expense funeral Insurance okay  
 then I'm going to lean in it's a little  
 bit different and I'm going to say which  
 one of those would you lean more towards  
 which one of those would you possibly  
 lean more towards uh I would say option  
 two really option two I thought you'd  
 say option one you're going to say the  
 worst one why option two well the reason  
 why we want option two is and they start  
 telling themselves why they want the  
 better option okay and then I might lean  
 in say do you feel like this is what  
 you're looking for to I don't know like  
 really take the burden off your kids so  
 they're not responsible they have to pay  
 for all those expenses when you when you  
 pass away notice how I'm plugging in  
 what I'm preventing from happening by  
 them getting that policy I'm preventing  
 them for their kids being burdened with  
 that responsibility to have to pay for  
 all those expenses when the parent  
 passes away which is hard for the parent  
 like no I want my kids to be burdened  
 with that okay well that makes sense  
 really The Next Step would be is to make  
 sure that you're eligible I wouldn't say  
 I'd say that over qualified I get that  
 pulled up to you and you go right into  
 that process that's just a different  
 kind of way  
 you would do um commitment questions for  
 like the life insurance health insurance  
 final expense Insurance compared to  
 something else now let's say if I'm a  
 real estate agent look at it do you feel  
 like this marketing plan we put in to  
 sell the home do you feel like that's  
 going to be the answer for you guys oh  
 for sure hold on why do you feel like it  
 is up well we like it because of this  
 because of that then I can say well I  
 don't really have anything else to go  
 over with you it looks like we covered  
 the basis of what you're looking for to  
 sell the property quickly really The  
 Next Step would be is we'd have you fill  
 out the listing agreement arrange for  
 the photographer to come out and take  
 pictures of your home and then start  
 listing it to make sure we can get it  
 sold quickly would that be appropriate  
 just a nice closing commitment question  
 all right I just gave you some different  
 examples of npq the psychology behind it  
 just gave you an overview there's a lot  
 more to that this is a YouTube video  
 right so this might be an hour hour and  
 15 minutes long connection questions to  
 situation questions to problem awareness  
 to solution awareness consequence  
 questions okay and then transition into  
 whatever the next step is if you're in a  
 one call conversation or close you're  
 going to transition in the presentation  
 if you're two call close or more you're  
 just going to transition to whatever the  
 next step is in your sales process and  
 then finally a few examples of  
 commitment questions to get them to  
 commit to take the next step and  
 purchase what you're offering hope that  
 helped you now you want to learn more  
 things like this because what I showed  
 you is very basic if you subscribe to  
 the Channel my only advice for you would  
 be do not share the Channel with anybody  
 who you compete with you don't want them  
 learning what I will show you in this in  
 Channel unless you like to have more  
 competitors now you got a friend  
 somebody else you know that's in a  
 different industry or you don't compete  
 with for sure by mean share it with them

 Advanced Chiropractic specializing in  
 neuropathy tell  
 me why should I go with you I have over  
 30 years of experience and I get  
 results why should I go with you you'll  
 tell me after we finish our conversation  
 okay I want all you you and you to come  
 up here with me on stage real quick come  
 on up let's  
 go are you a chiropractor or a case  
 manager I'm a chiropractor one of the  
 smart guys  
 okay if I asked any of your competitors  
 in your city the same question and I  
 said why should I go with them what do  
 you think they might say something very  
 similar but without the  
 confidence if I asked your competitors  
 any of them in your city the same exact  
 question what do you think think they  
 would say they tell you what they do H  
 and if I asked your competitors the same  
 exact question what do you think they  
 would say they would say that their  
 business is the best because they get  
 results and they specialize in whatever  
 it is you are experiencing okay so what  
 I think I just heard all of you say is  
 that in your prospect's mind you all  
 sound the what you all sound the same  
 could that be a problem for  
 you okay all right you guys can sit down  
 lovely job well done now be ready  
 because I've been known to bring you  
 back up and a lot of other people you  
 might want to be on your toes today now  
 if I asked you to  
 describe the word sales or  
 selling in just one simple word now if  
 you're one of our clients because I've  
 seen several clients in here zip it  
 right  
 now but if I asked you to describe the  
 word sales or  
 selling in just one word what would that  
 word  
 be tell me what would that word be if I  
 asked you to describe the word sales or  
 selling in one word what would that word  
 be service service what else  
 growth needs what  
 else persuasion what else pushy pushy  
 what else influence influence what else  
 scary scary could be trouble okay what  
 if we took everything all of you just  
 said and we wrapped it into one word and  
 that word was  
 this  
 change  
 change all sales are all selling is is  
 simply  
 change it's about how good you are at  
 getting your prospects to view the in  
 their mind that by them changing their  
 situation that means purchasing you know  
 treatment plans from you that by them  
 doing that that is far less risky for  
 them than them doing nothing at all  
 staying in the status quo their problems  
 stay the same and nothing ever  
 changes which is more  
 risky  
 now here's your biggest problem human  
 beings don't like  
 change what I just said all selling is  
 is change yet human beings don't like  
 change even though we say we do and why  
 do we not like change we especially do  
 not like change when it's initiated by  
 some pushy salesperson case manager  
 chiropractor that tries to push their  
 Solutions too early in the conversation  
 and repeatedly human behavior shows that  
 we value  
 something that is more familiar to us  
 even if we don't like it that much over  
 something that is new something that is  
 foreign to us would I be right I'll give  
 you an example raise your hand if you  
 know anybody a friend a relative a  
 neighbor a business associate somebody  
 you work with that complains every  
 single day about the relationship  
 they're in raise your hand everybody has  
 the person right oh they're this they're  
 that they're this and you always wonder  
 what why they stay in the relationship  
 well why is that because they're human  
 and they're afraid of ch change oh  
 there's that word change again see  
 that's what you're going up against to  
 some degree with pretty much every  
 potential customer you're ever going to  
 talk to  
 now it's okay how do we  
 help your prospects overcome the fear of  
 change it's quite easy Once you acquire  
 the skill sets to do that it's really  
 really hard if you don't now how do we  
 do that how are we going to do that  
 together here's where're we're going to  
 start one thing that we all have to  
 realize is this very simple notion is  
 that you're not selling the  
 thing what are you selling you're  
 selling the results of what that thing  
 does now for every potential customer  
 you talk to that could be different  
 right for somebody it could be you're  
 selling them on what what the treatment  
 plan does because it's going to save  
 their foot from being amputated that's  
 what you're selling you might be selling  
 somebody else by allowing them to be  
 able to walk so they can enjoy their  
 grandkids growing up or golfing with  
 their friends you might be selling a  
 treatment plan the results of that that  
 gets rid of their chronic headach so  
 they can go back to work and provide for  
 their family see that's what you're  
 selling the results of what the  
 treatment plans do not the treatment  
 plans itself are you with me on that all  
 right now how do we do this  
 together here's a question that we have  
 to ask ourselves how are each of you  
 going to stand out in your prospect's  
 mind because from what I heard up here  
 from what you were saying we all sound  
 the same to the Prospect and because we  
 sound the same what do they do  
 commoditize you right say it's too  
 expensive I need something  
 cheaper see where we're at okay now why  
 does that happen how are you going to  
 have a competitive advantage over  
 everybody else in 2024 2025 and for  
 decades to come how do you stand  
 out every chiropractor Services say what  
 is anybody saying we're the 15th best in  
 the  
 city no we all say we're good we can do  
 it we we all say we can get it done so  
 in your prospect's mind we all sound  
 very similar so how do we stand out in  
 their mind all of you are learning from  
 this event and from the the the you know  
 coaching programs with Dr gum and their  
 team Systems Operations marketing you're  
 all learning that so what causes you to  
 stand out in their  
 mind simply  
 this it's right here write that down the  
 ones who will own this upcoming Market  
 are simply the ones who learn how to  
 best communicate with their prospects  
 that simple the ones who know what to  
 say and ask that will cause their  
 prospects to want to engage to want to  
 open up  
 instead of trying to get rid of you so  
 what gives you the competitive advantage  
 today I'm going to show you three things  
 number  
 one here's what we're going to talk  
 about how do you become the trusted  
 Authority in your prospect's mind how do  
 they view you as the market leader the  
 expert who they will never go away from  
 no matter  
 what here we go number one we talked  
 about earlier we have to learn how to  
 become a problem finder Problem Solver  
 not a product Pusher product pushers  
 don't do that well that's why they get  
 commoditized on pricing number two  
 asking the right questions but at the  
 right time and especially with the right  
 tone tonality Jeremy what are you  
 talking about that might be important to  
 you anybody ever read a book that says  
 93% of communication is by your  
 nonverbal your body language and your  
 tonality anybody ever learned how to use  
 your body language and tonality advanced  
 learning nobody how many years have all  
 of you gone to sales and persuasion  
 School how many years did you go to  
 chiropractic  
 school oh okay could be a problem there  
 now there's some questions that we have  
 to learn that require more of a a  
 curious tone there's other questions we  
 have to learn that require more of a  
 confused tone what does that mean Jeremy  
 there's other questions you're going to  
 have to learn that require more of a  
 challenging tone there's others that are  
 going to require more of a concern tone  
 a tone that shows more  
 empathy are you 100% sure the questions  
 you're using now are the right  
 ones are you 100% sure that you know how  
 to use your tonality to get your  
 prospects to emotionally open up  
 and number  
 three eliminating sales  
 resistance so your prospects let their  
 guard  
 down all right I'm going to tell you I'm  
 going to give you a little bit of my  
 background because my background relates  
 to what is necessary if you want to take  
 your business if you own the practice or  
 practices or if your case maner managers  
 salese you want to take your sales to a  
 level that most people don't believe  
 they can get to now I got started in  
 sales 23 years ago as a broke burned out  
 college student and I got my first job  
 selling home security systems door too  
 raise your hand if you ever sold door  
 too raise your hand got to see who my  
 people were that's where I started now  
 you know what we went through right they  
 give you the script they give you a  
 couple books by the sales gurus they  
 drive you out in a van am I right you  
 guys starting to remember this they  
 drive you out in a van and they  
 basically do this they kick you out of  
 the van and they say go make some sales  
 it'll be easy we'll pick you up after  
 dark everybody with door to door people  
 you know it and I still remember being  
 the last one blocked dropped off in the  
 block I looked back at my sales manager  
 in the van his name was exan Anderson he  
 had the Cur you know the surfer guys the  
 blonde hair you know how they talk and  
 he's like yo Minor remember when you  
 knock on the door show them how excited  
 you are show them your enthusiasm show  
 them that you believe in the product and  
 they're going to believe in the product  
 I was like that makes sense if I believe  
 in it if I'm really excited they're  
 somehow going to be excited as well what  
 did I know so I started knocking on the  
 doors and I started talking about my  
 features and benefits and I was really  
 excited and I said we were the number  
 one in the market there and we could do  
 the best installs and we had the best  
 customer service and the highest quality  
 of products and service and we had the  
 best owners and we had a triaa rating  
 with the Better Business Bureau and  
 suddenly to my dismay from the very  
 first door I started getting all these  
 objections what they didn't tell me  
 about that we don't need it we can't  
 afford it it's too expensive we already  
 talk with somebody from your company I  
 need to talk with my house I need to do  
 more research I need to keep looking  
 around I need to think it over can you  
 call me back in a week a month a year  
 later raise your hand if you've ever got  
 any of those objections only half the  
 room some of you never get any  
 objections you guys are good now after  
 probably SE that's actually no picture  
 of me that's crazy after about s to  
 eight weeks of non-stop rejection barely  
 making any sales now when you're door to  
 door do they pay you a really high base  
 salary oh no straight commission so  
 everybody gets hired so if you don't  
 make sales you don't make any mola not  
 good for you so after about 7 to 8 weeks  
 of all that remember standing on a curve  
 one late Friday evening you know the  
 Summers anybody been in those door to  
 door summer programs just a few you know  
 if you have you know what I'm talking  
 about just sweat driping down your chest  
 your back your legs just jell after like  
 13 hours of walking around the doors  
 door slammed in your face made zero  
 sales that day so zero 0 an hour and in  
 fact for the entire week I'd worked like  
 65 hours and made zero sales so that  
 means $0 an hour and I remember feeling  
 to myself you know maybe  
 selling maybe selling just wasn't for  
 me maybe I just wasn't a born  
 salesperson like everybody  
 else have you ever felt that way  
 yourself  
 have you ever looked at your bank  
 account and you had more going out than  
 you had coming in that's where I was  
 at now when xay the surfer manager  
 picked me up that day he popped in a  
 Tony Robins CD where he was talking  
 about skill level that completely  
 changed my viewpoint of what skills  
 actually meant yes 22 years ago they us  
 used to listen to these round things  
 called CDs I know it's kind of weird is  
 it right now Tony said something like  
 this  
 Tony forgive me if you're listening I  
 might have be butchering this this was a  
 long time ago he said  
 this he  
 said you will  
 fail you will  
 fail if you don't learn the right skills  
 necessary to succeed you will  
 fail if you don't learn the right skills  
 now here's the kicker he went on to say  
 everybody's taught skills  
 we're all taught skills when we get into  
 any job right but he said the people who  
 don't do as well are the ones who are  
 not taught the right ones that there's  
 skill level that can be taught by people  
 who are far more successful that get you  
 a high level of success compared to low  
 skill level now for me as a 21-year-old  
 kid 22 at that time that was like a  
 light bulb moment that was  
 like I would say  
 divine intervention from the heavens  
 that maybe just maybe what the company  
 was training me what I was learning from  
 the sales gurus maybe they just weren't  
 the right skills anymore maybe they're  
 just outdated didn't work as well so I  
 was like okay I've got to do something  
 $0 an  
 hour probably not going to help that  
 much I have to learn how to do  
 this  
 because I I know  
 you like  
 me want to provide a great Liv to your  
 family is that why you're here today you  
 all came here because you want to do  
 what you want to improve your skill  
 level now here was my major dilemma  
 though because I was using these  
 traditional selling skills from the  
 company and from the gurus I would  
 notice some of them would  
 work let's get some pictures up there I  
 noticed some of those would  
 work when I use  
 them gers but I noticed a lot of them  
 didn't work very well at all and I would  
 use them I would actually see my  
 prospects like the body language like  
 kind of tense up you ever seen that when  
 you've used some of those techniques you  
 can tell that they're like oh my gosh  
 and you I would ask questions and they  
 would give me vague generalized surface  
 L answers raise your hand if you ask  
 questions and you get vague generalized  
 surface level answers and their feet are  
 about to fall off could why is that and  
 I'm like what what is causing that what  
 am I doing wrong I would notice they  
 would just stay surface level and just  
 shut down all the time now at the same  
 time I was in college my major is  
 Behavioral Science in human psychology  
 the study of the brain and how human  
 beings make  
 decisions would that be important if  
 we're wanting to learn Le to persuade  
 and influence our prospects if we know  
 how their brain makes decisions why do  
 they say no instead of yes what's going  
 on up there that triggers that reaction  
 now my  
 professors they were telling me that the  
 most persuasive way to communicate was  
 here the gurus and all their programs  
 basically here so we're talking exact  
 opposite so I'm like what do I do here  
 how do I learn how do I learn how to ask  
 the right WR  
 questions that would get my prospects to  
 pull me in cuz I didn't like the pushy  
 pressure who in here likes to push and  
 pressure no bueno because when you do it  
 you feel what you feel what when you do  
 it what do you feel you feel kind of  
 weird what do you think the prospect's  
 feeling if you feel that it could be  
 trouble right so how do I learn how to  
 use my body language how do I use my  
 tone to get my prospects to let their  
 guard down and actually want to open up  
 to me and tell me what the real problems  
 are so I started learning these  
 techniques that would work with human  
 behavior and I started to get my  
 prospects to do all the  
 work I started to get my prospects to  
 sell themselves I started to get my  
 prospects to overcome their own concerns  
 and I started to get them to learn how  
 to get them to pull me in and all of a  
 sudden selling became very enjoyable  
 very easy and exceptionally profitable  
 now why do I tell why did I just tell  
 you my  
 story CU none of you care about my  
 story whose story do you care about your  
 story right you're a human being this is  
 be human behavior 101 I told you that  
 because I want you to imagine me within  
 four years of  
 that of like 0 per day within four years  
 of that I was making multiple seven  
 figures in commissions every year here  
 as a W2  
 salesperson four years before I almost  
 quit because I believe the lie that  
 you're either a born salesperson or  
 not you see  
 I'm I'm  
 not I'm not  
 anyone  
 famous in  
 fact I'm just like  
 you  
 I'm a person who very early in their  
 life realized if I wanted to have a  
 great lifesty for my future family I was  
 not going to have to I couldn't follow  
 the status quo like everybody else that  
 if I was going to be in sales I couldn't  
 use the techniques everybody else was  
 using because I would what get the same  
 results you see unfortunately for me I  
 wasn't born out of my mother's womb with  
 Advanced questioning skills raise your  
 hand if you're born with Advanced  
 questioning skills oh nobody I wasn't  
 born out of my mother's womb with  
 advance adved tonality skills raise your  
 hand if you were born with Advanced  
 tonality skills oh nobody see I wasn't  
 born with Advanced objection handling  
 and prevention  
 skills I had to acquire those skills I  
 had to learn those  
 skills so if a kid who grew up in the  
 middle of  
 Missouri on a cattle ranch outside of a  
 town with less than 800 people can  
 acquire those skills what does it mean  
 to  
 you it means you can do it too even if  
 you're doing really well in your  
 practice or as a case manager once you  
 acquire more skills more advanced skills  
 you can do what 2 3 5 10 you can grow  
 you can write your own ticket anywhere  
 in the world now how are we going to do  
 this because it's all talk until we what  
 it's all dreaming until we what we learn  
 the skills see you all dreamed about  
 being a chiropractor until you what what  
 learned how to be a chiropractor I can't  
 believe it this is crazy now become a  
 problem finder Problem Solver not a  
 product Pusher raise your  
 hand if the prospects you talk  
 to have problems and or emotional needs  
 raise your hand if I don't see every  
 hand rais I'm coming after you right now  
 I can see you back there everything ever  
 invented solves a problem and or  
 emotional need right does a Ferrari  
 $500,000 Ferrari solve a problem not  
 really unless you're race car driver cuz  
 you can drive from point A to point B  
 with a 2005 Toyota right but what does  
 it do solves a emotional need higher  
 status maybe my dad told me I wouldn't  
 amount anything when I was a kid I'm  
 going to prove him wrong maybe I got  
 picked on in school now I'm going to  
 show everybody I'm successful everything  
 solves a problem and or emotional need  
 your services do  
 both that's why it's really easy to do  
 once you learn this now I want I want  
 you to take the next 30 seconds grab a  
 pen and a piece of paper I'm watching  
 and I want you to write down the two  
 biggest problems that your prospects  
 have write down the two biggest problems  
 that your prospects have I'm going to  
 give you youve got 27 seconds left I  
 would to write these down I'm going to  
 come around and ask some of you what are  
 the two biggest problems and or  
 emotional needs that your prospects have  
 two biggest problems  
 got the countdown here two biggest  
 problems what are  
 they two biggest  
 problems somebody tell me which your two  
 biggest problems just shout it out pain  
 pain okay more specific unaware of the  
 reality of their situation the biggest  
 problem that you have is the problem you  
 don't know you have well said I like  
 that what else lack of lack of what hope  
 lack of Hope need yes they don't know  
 what's wrong they keep going they can't  
 figure it out so they're always worried  
 right what else what  
 aom what autonomy yes okay  
 good well that's not that's not a  
 problem you  
 solve what do you solve like what the  
 problems you solve that's what I mean  
 let me be more specific what are the  
 problems you solve go  
 ahead I think a lot of our patients  
 don't believe that oh you know what do  
 we have a microphone I do have a  
 microphone  
 okay  
 yes here we go patience don't oh can you  
 hold that oh yes thank you patients  
 don't believe in the process that they  
 can actually be healed why because a lot  
 of medical doctors tell them there's no  
 cure for what we treat okay and it's  
 your job to do what to change their mind  
 to let them believe if we tell them that  
 the doctors are wrong they might do what  
 leave not believe us so we have to get  
 them to reframe that way of thinking and  
 come to that conclusion themselves  
 correct more persuasive what's another  
 problem in emotional need that we  
 solve fear oh yes we got we got she  
 thank  
 you fear of  
 what fear of surgery future okay now  
 here's what I want you to do here's the  
 exercise raise your hand so look at the  
 problems that you wrote down or that you  
 have in your mind raise your hand  
 if your solution solves those  
 problems only seven of you well you're  
 going to go out of business if you don't  
 solve problems right if you can't solve  
 problems why do they need you right so  
 everything solves a problem now here's  
 what I'm hearing you say in your  
 mind if your prospects have problems and  
 or emotional  
 needs and your solution solves  
 those so if my prospects have problems  
 my solution solves those why are so many  
 not buying from  
 you they have the problems you can solve  
 them why are they not buying from  
 you what's the missing  
 link can I make a  
 suggestion will you not get angry at  
 me you  
 sure it's not your prospects or your  
 leads oh my prospects they're all broke  
 they just have a fear-based mindset  
 well no  
  whose job is it to help him  
 overcome that that's why you get paid so  
 much money right it's not that it's not  
 your mindset it's not that you don't  
 Journal enough it's not that you don't  
 meditate enough it's not that you don't  
 take enough cold  
 showers how's that going to help you  
 when the prospect says hello I love that  
 not going to help you sell more it's not  
 that you don't read enough personal  
 development I love personal development  
 not going to help you sell more they're  
 on the stands out there not going to  
 help you it's not you're that you're not  
 motivated enough you're all here you're  
 I'm assuming motivated and it's  
 definitely not that you don't work hard  
 now raise your hand if you work hard you  
 all work hard so if it's none of that  
 what is it on it and it didn't work now  
 before I suggest what it could  
 be can I ask you a really like cheesy  
 question that I already know the answer  
 to raise your hand if you if you're if  
 you own the  
 the fac the practice raise your hand if  
 you want to Triple your Revenue in the  
 next 12 months triple your Revenue it's  
 harder to Triple profit margin but let's  
 say double profit margin triple Revenue  
 raise your hand now if you're a case  
 manager and you're the one selling raise  
 your hand if you want to Triple sales in  
 the next year okay so we all know yes  
 cheesy question Jeremy obviously  
 now keep Your Hand raised raise raise  
 your everybody raise your  
 hands keep your hands  
 raised if if you can triple the hours  
 you're working  
 now what Jeremy how am I going to Triple  
 my Revenue in sales how am I going to  
 Triple my sales I mean you already work  
 8 to 10 hours a day you're going to work  
 24 plus I don't think that's  
 scientifically possible right so if you  
 can't triple your hours you're going to  
 have to do what you're going to have to  
 learn more what Advanced skills and  
 sales ability than you currently possess  
 see it's what you're saying it's what  
 you're not asking it's how you haven't  
 don't know how to use your tone yet that  
 is causing so many of your prospects to  
 not purchase from you even though their  
 feet might fall off next week once you  
 learn what to say once you learn the  
 right questions and how to get them to  
 emotionally open up not just tell you  
 their physical pain physical pain is not  
 going to close many deals for you you're  
 going to get the easy ones how do we get  
 them to open up emotionally that's where  
 the sales made once you learn that  
 everything becomes possible now who in  
 here likes to read  
 books you you don't some of you don't  
 like to read books in your chiropractors  
 you read a lot of books in school I'm  
 assuming I love to read books okay my  
 first sales seminar I ever went to was  
 the summer of the end of summer of 2001  
 in Salt Lake City Utah close to where I  
 was going to school with Brian Tracy  
 raise your hand if you've ever heard of  
 Brian Tracy pring my forever great  
 friend of mine now Brian's great now  
 Brian said something there that  
 completely changed my outlook he said  
 use your  
 vehicle as a university on Wheels and  
 from that day forward I like I just  
 turned off the radio if you know me  
 you're like yeah he's weird he doesn't  
 listen to the radio he doesn't listen to  
 like Fox News political shows or CNN he  
 doesn't listen to Taylor Swift what the  
 hell's wrong with that guy I can't  
 believe he would waste his time on  
 learning how to sell more what an idiot  
 I I can't believe it and so from that  
 day I started reading or listening to  
 Five Books a month times 12 months a  
 year times the past 23 years on sales  
 persuasion influence if I did the math  
 correctly well you know I was I am from  
 Arkansas who's from  
 Arkansas okay I can't tell that joke I'm  
 not going to tell it I from Arkansas so  
 I can joke about myself but  
 anyways I think if I got the math right  
 it's like  
 1,386 books or something who's counting  
 on sales persuasion influence now in  
 every single book you've ever read on  
 sales persuasion influence what are the  
 three common things they say  
 sales is a numbers  
 game ABCs  
 of  
 closing and you have to be a problem  
 solver those are pretty common right but  
 if you look at what a problem solver  
 means if your potential customers don't  
 buy from you how the hell are you a  
 problem solver see problem solving  
 happens after they buy and after you're  
 treating them when you solve their  
 problems problem solving does not happen  
 before you want to get a lot more  
 clients in your are two three five times  
 more clients in your and expand Across  
 the Nation we've got clients that are  
 doing that every single day you got to  
 be much better at problem finding you  
 might want to write that down now what  
 does problem finding mean it means this  
 realize this I think all of you would  
 know this most of your prospects when  
 you first start talking to them don't  
 even know what their real problems are  
 raise your hand if I'd be right most of  
 your prospects when you talk to them  
 don't really understand what the real  
 problems are or if they know they have a  
 problem they don't understand what how  
 bad that problem really is would I be  
 right are they experts like you are and  
 they especially don't know what what the  
 consequences are if they don't do  
 anything about solving the problems  
 because if we can't get them to find  
 problems in their mind that they didn't  
 understand they have they don't feel any  
 urgency to what  
 change and if they don't feel any  
 urgency to change there is no  
 sale do you see where we're going with  
 this all right now what are most sales  
 people most case  
 managers chiropractors I love you guys  
 but everybody's in sales right we're  
 trying to influence every day most  
 people have been trained unfortunately  
 to be what we call product  
 pushers we ask a few logical based  
 questions um can you tell me the what  
 are your what are your what's your  
 concerns that brought you in today John  
 oh okay how long have you had that going  
 on oh wow what have you tried to do to  
 treat it in the past oh okay well let me  
 show you what we can do to solve that  
 and then we're shocked and amazed 30  
 minutes later when they say we want to  
 think it over when their nerves are  
 about to be pinched up from their feet  
 and they're going to lose their feet in  
 like a couple months you're like how did  
 that  
 happen why why did that happen they have  
 problems you can solve them what  
 happened  
 because the questions we're asking are  
 surface level and there's no emotion and  
 it's like taking a bucket of  
 mud and throwing it up against the wall  
 hoping and praying that something we  
 show them on slide 12 is going to  
 magically trigger them to want to spend  
 all this money with  
 us and I call that hopium it's a drug  
 that so many of you are still  
 taking that is a very hard and  
 unpredictable way to scale your PR  
 practice don't do drugs if you want to  
 be in the top 1% the hopium drug is not  
 good for you all right let's go to step  
 number two we got to start learning how  
 to do this now sub number two asking the  
 right questions but at the right time oh  
 and especially at the right tonality now  
 let's go back to where I was at remember  
 I was at College studying Behavioral  
 Science human psychology the study of  
 the brain how human beings make  
 decisions why do they say no instead of  
 saying yes when they have problems  
 what's triggering that the prospect wake  
 up that morning and  
 plan when they walked into your office  
 that within the first 3  
 minutes because you sounded a little bit  
 too excited and ending your sentences on  
 a high note that it triggered their  
 fight ORF flight part of their brain to  
 say hey can you just tell me how much  
 it's going to cost I can tell you if I'm  
 interested did they plan that  
 out or was it maybe something you were  
 saying and how use your tone that  
 triggered their survival part of their  
 brain to react that way oh okay we might  
 learn something today all right now  
 let's keep going here how did they make  
 decisions how are they persuaded now oh  
 let's go back now here's what I'm going  
 to  
 do love these clickers some of them are  
 very very touchy oh jeez touchy one here  
 now here's what I'm going to have you do  
 write this down Accord to Behavioral  
 Science there are three forms of  
 communication  
 I would write this down because once you  
 understand the differences in where you  
 are now compared to where you could be  
 even if you're already doing well it  
 will be a game changer for you so the  
 first mode of communication it's called  
 era one type of selling I'm not going to  
 give the scientific term for it I'd bore  
 to death but if I said the words Boiler  
 Room selling Boiler Room selling what's  
 the first image that comes to your brain  
 Boiler Room selling what's the first  
 image that comes to your brain right now  
 what's the first image  
 what speak up what pressure like this  
 see I already gave it away this remember  
 the movie wolf on Wall Street hey I got  
 a great opportunity for you we talk  
 about the features the benefits and we  
 start to push and pressure and tell them  
 why we should why they should go with us  
 and why we're the best and anybody ever  
 done that but according to the  
 data the pesky data were the least  
 persuasive when we sell that  
 way hence sales is a numbers game it's a  
 numbers game because of  
 what the way we're communicating is  
 triggering it to be a numbers game right  
 we never thought about that when we tell  
 people things when we attempt to  
 dominate them we attempt to posture them  
 when we attempt to manipulate them when  
 we push and pressure them we are the  
 least  
 persuasive it's just like if who's got  
 teenagers that are like 13 18 you tell  
 them you really really need to do  
 something then you push them pressure  
 what do they do back they push back oh  
 my gosh now second mode now I'm going to  
 show you a few of the least persuasive  
 ways to sell presenting we've all been  
 taught amazing presentation we've got to  
 have the 45 minute to hour slide decks  
 we showed them the pictures of the  
 corporate office because it looks really  
 pretty with those cool windows we showed  
 them the pictures of the founders you  
 know they have the most Integrity right  
 you heard that one here's our triaa  
 Customer Service Awards here's our AAA  
 rating to Better Business Bureau we have  
 the best this we have the best that I  
 have the most years experience w w w w  
 that's what the prospect hears would I  
 be possibly right there how we have the  
 best how many salese do you  
 know they try to sell you something  
 they're  
 like we're the 17th best in the nation  
 we're the 17th best in the market no  
 nobody says everybody says they're the  
 best right so when we hear things like  
 every other salesperson says and  
 especially if we talk down about our  
 competitors our prospects do what well  
 psychologically they start to trust you  
 less even if you are the most  
 experienced they don't have any trust or  
 credibility to believe that because  
 everybody says they are right nobody  
 says I have the least experience in the  
 city right so they're used to that  
 according to the data if your  
 presentation if you're talking more than  
 10% of that sales process you are losing  
 sales you could be making now here's  
 your problem the average salesperson in  
 every industry we train 161 different  
 Industries including yours the average  
 person selling is presenting over half  
 of the time that is a big problem whole  
 another training on that let's go to  
 another telling your story we talked  
 about nobody cares about your story when  
 you're selling one to one whose story do  
 they care about their own story what  
 about putting sales pressure on them  
 were you taught to do that or maybe you  
 don't know you might be doing that see  
 there's a massive difference between  
 getting a prospect to feel so much  
 internal tension from your  
 questionability  
 that seeds doubt that they might have  
 more problems than they originally  
 thought they had compared to putting  
 external sales pressure on them cuz that  
 what wears off when they leave you ever  
 had a prospect that signed up for your  
 stuff and then called back a day or two  
 and said  
 what oh I'm so sorry but we just can't  
 afford it oh I'm so sorry we're just not  
 going to be able to do it you're like  
 what you have all these problems what  
 happened external pressure where it's  
 your idea not their idea what if about  
 the big one oh here's the big one some  
 of you are going to get really angry  
 with me at this one I  
 know assuming the  
 sale especially if it's too early in the  
 conversation before You' built a big  
 enough Gap and it's exactly why some of  
 the sales Traders you've learned from  
 say what sales is a what numbers game  
 call more leads work more harder get  
 thick skin get more nose that lead to  
 the yes anybody ever heard that raise  
 your hand  
 so basically what they just said is well  
 unfortunately what I'm training you  
 doesn't really work that well so  
 unfortunately for you you're just going  
 to have to work harder just work more  
 hours you can do it go get them how  
 selfish of them is  
 that how does that give you any  
 competitive Advantage you're just going  
 to work more hours good luck I'd rather  
 work Less hours and have more skill  
 right let's keep going here all right  
 second ER sah consultative selling came  
 out in the late '70s early s books like  
 spin selling uh Sandler Institute uh  
 spin selling book Neil rackam college  
 professor never sold anything by the way  
 and they taught that you needed to ask  
 logical based questions or questions to  
 find the needs of the client we call  
 those surface level questions what's the  
 problem though when you only know how to  
 ask logical based surface level  
 questions what answers are the prospects  
 going to give you logical based service  
 level answers do human beings Buy on  
 emotion or  
 logic all of you have heard emotion  
 every decision you make I feel like  
 getting a  
 drink I feel like sitting in this chair  
 starts with your emotional side of the  
 brain you cannot make decisions without  
 your emotional side of the brain you are  
 a vegetable if you're in a wreck and  
 your emotional side of your brain is  
 damaged you can't go pee you can't  
 decide I feel like going to the bathroom  
 would I be right okay so how do we get  
 to open up now when we ask these type of  
 questions  
 we're still losing people because we're  
 not bringing out their emotions okay and  
 it's it's why I always say you can't  
 just sell to the  
 needs of the  
 client why can I not just sell to the  
 needs of the  
 client because most of them don't know  
 what they need when I first start  
 talking to them oh my gosh my my my  
 chronic headaches hurt really bad oh  
 they do here you go take this that's not  
 going to help them that much right  
 that's what they let me give you an  
 example I'll just tell you this this is  
 for illustrative purposes this is not  
 going to happen to any of you okay Law  
 of  
 Attraction let's say you wake up  
 tomorrow morning you have a really bad  
 migraine you're like oh my God my head  
 hurts so bad I need some  
 medication I got to go to urgent care I  
 got to co-pay it's going to be 100 bucks  
 that's my budget cuz that's what I think  
 I need I go to urgent care and the  
 doctor she starts to ask me some pointed  
 questions about the pain  
 and where I feel the pain and what the  
 pain feels like and what the Pain's  
 doing to me and what the pains  
 preventing me from being able to do and  
 other questions and all of a sudden her  
 questions start to get you to feel what  
  I might have a much bigger problem  
 than I originally thought you had that's  
 what internal  
 tension she then says you need to do a  
 CAT scan nice hat brother I like  
 that comes back they have a ter to Tor  
 in your head terminal got 2 weeks left  
 to live now she can solve that problem  
 it's a $2 million  
 surgery your insurance covers 90%  
 leaving you the $200,000 Bill well the  
 hell with a $100 budget you thought you  
 only needed a budget for $100 because  
 you didn't know what what you needed but  
 now you know what you need so you're  
 going to do what go out and find the  
 budget that's why you never sell to just  
 the needs you sell to the real problems  
 your questioning and tonality ability  
 allow the prospect to find that they  
 didn't understand they have let's go to  
 the third mode and then I'm going to  
 show you some examples for your  
 industry third mode now oh you let me  
 show you I see a lot of questions our  
 sales trainers and I in the conference  
 room we see a lot of scripts we train  
 tons of practices a lot of case managers  
 in your space as well so we see a lot of  
 these surface level questions can I  
 suggest that we not use these no bueno  
 hey what's the major concern that  
 brought you in here today most people  
 say  
 what oh my head  
 hurts physical pain right oh how long  
 has that been going on how long have you  
 had it what have you tried to do to help  
 it and then you do  
 what what do you do  
 next jump in and how tell them how you  
 can solve it because you're very smart  
 you're very educated but what's the  
 problem with  
 that well the problem is is you're only  
 getting the physical  
 pain you're not getting the what the  
 emotional pain that's where the sale is  
 made if you're only getting the physical  
 pain you're only going to get the lay  
 down easy seals where they're like like  
 limping God please like you're getting  
 those but you're not getting all the  
 other ones that are kind of like oh kind  
 of really hurts but you know if they  
 don't do anything about it it's going to  
 get really bad those are the ones you're  
 missing because of the emotional pain  
 okay now how do we get them to open up  
 emotionally how do we do that here's how  
 we do that the Third  
 mode most persuasive when we get others  
 to persuade themselves according to  
 Behavioral Science how do we get others  
 to persuade themselves we do that when  
 we ask what are called neuro emotional  
 persuasion questions that stands for neq  
 now a lot of you are saying okay Jeremy  
 this sounds really good but how do I do  
 it that's a trillion dollar question  
 raise your hand if you want to start  
 learning how to do that are you going to  
 be able to master  
 this today at a  
 seminar you can't teach a kid how to  
 ride a bike at a seminar are right well  
 we're going to  
 start so how do we do it okay now what  
 I'm talking about npq questions I want  
 to be very specific I'm not referring to  
 questions that are designed to get your  
 prospects to say what you want them to  
 say anybody heard of if you get the  
 prospect to say yes seven times there's  
 71% more chance of them buying anybody  
 ever heard that did you know there's no  
 evidence of that literally no scientific  
 data that shows that zero zils done in  
 fact if you were our clients I'm we  
 would train you several questions in  
 certain context where we want them to to  
 you to ask questions that get them to  
 say no that trigger them to say yes oo  
 let's see what that is all right so  
 we're going to talk about that now here  
 are the stages of  
 npq five  
 stages seen some of our clients in here  
 you guys know this okay I don't have  
 time to go through all these because  
 they said they're throwing me off the  
 stage in about 38 minutes but who would  
 like to see just a few examples of neq  
 questions for what you do okay now for  
 some of those that didn't raise their  
 hand over there you got to close your  
 eyes and like put the ear muffs on you  
 raise your hand back there that's all  
 you okay so what are we going to  
 do now before I get into that because  
 this is all going to set this up how do  
 I get my  
 prospects to view you at a higher status  
 than someone trying to sell them  
 something what are salespeople anybody  
 trying to sell something what are they  
 in society viewed at large  
 as lower status would we be right does  
 Hollywood ever make any movies about the  
 hero sales  
 people no they're always pushy high  
 pressure because that's typically how  
 Society Abus us right how do we raise  
 our status in their mind now Behavioral  
 Science this is called social  
 dynamics now should I show  
 you some predictable  
 questions that most of you are using now  
 because your mother said you need to be  
 polite to  
 strangers that are actually lowering  
 your status and your prospects mind  
 every single day and you don't even know  
 it do you want me to show you a few of  
 those there's like a lot there's i' say  
 couple hundred but I'm going to show you  
 two now here's my concern if I show you  
 these it's really going to mess on your  
 mind when you start talking with  
 prospects again on  
 Monday it's going to mess you up you're  
 going to be like oh no am I lowering  
 their Stratus what's going on  
 so if I show you  
 these you can't get angry at me because  
 I'm going to show you to reward them or  
 you raise your status okay now we have  
 two  
 choices we can keep taking the blue pill  
 oh that blue pill is easy we can take  
 the easy  
 pill in fact the easy pill is so  
 freaking easy that it rarely works but  
 we don't have to do anything we can take  
 the hopium  
 drug keep taking hopium drub I'm going  
 to just get more leads I'm going to get  
 better marketing somehow one day I'll  
 learn how to do this I'm young I don't  
 need to learn how to communicate now  
 I'll just do it in 5 years so we can  
 take keep the blue pill sales is a  
 numbers game we're just going to have it  
 a numbers game or we can take the red  
 pill and actually Master it that's the  
 skills  
 game numbers game Skills game which path  
 what do you want to do Skills game red  
 pill okay it's a good one I like it's a  
 lot funner we get to help more people  
 because if we if we if we don't have  
 more clients we don't help people why  
 did you become a chiropractor to do what  
 help people but if we can't communicate  
 we can't help  
 people it's all aligned now when you ask  
 questions like this oh boy here we go oh  
 hey welcome in how you doing today how's  
 your day going John oh it's so oh it's  
 I'm so happy that you came in here to  
 talk with us today that weather out  
 there is really bad did you see the game  
 last night the Cowboys just  
 disheartening they got Bea in the  
 playoffs  
 again  
 yeah here's how most of your prospects  
 interpret this unless they're lay down  
 unless you already have a relationship  
 with them if they are if they don't know  
 you here's how most of your prospects  
 interpret this is exactly how you  
 interpret it when salese that you don't  
 know say how you doing today welcome  
 into the dealership how are you doing  
 today you do this you  
 say I'm just trying to get you to like  
 me so I can sell you my product my  
 service my thing that's how you  
 interpret that because of why now some  
 of you like no Jeremy I really really  
 genuinely care about each of my  
 prospects day I'd be highly suspicious  
 if you really do on every single  
 Prospect you're not telling me the truth  
 but even if if you do your prospects  
 don't believe you because why because  
 every single sales person that's ever  
 tried to sell them anything is asking  
 him what predictable questions the same  
 ones you're asking so they associate  
 their brain Associates with who  
 automatically salespeople trying to sell  
 me something and the guard goes up and  
 you thought you were just being polite  
 cuz Mama said tell people how ask them  
 how they're doing okay so we're going to  
 show you differences now I'm going to  
 show you how to raise your status usion  
 your tonality with some of these  
 questions so when I'm doing this I want  
 you to pay attention these are five  
 tones that if you master them and even  
 if you use the same questions you're  
 using now just by mastering tonal you  
 could probably double your what you're  
 doing and don't even you could even  
 change anything now you learn the right  
 questions unless you're you're at the  
 top okay write this down your tone is  
 how your prospect interprets the  
 intention behind every question you ask  
 your tone your tonality is how your  
 prospects interpret the  
 intention behind the questions you're  
 asking we might want to learn  
 that what if I did  
 this can you stand up for a  
 second I'm so disappointed in  
 you what did you just feel  
 what did you just feel I felt like I  
 disappointed I felt but what else did  
 you what else did you feel I'm so  
 disappointed in you insecure okay and  
 you might get a little defensive right  
 probably okay what if I did  
 this I'm so disappointed in  
 you I'd feel like I was in grade school  
 and my mom was upset with me again let  
 me try  
 again I'm so disappointed in  
 you like you probably  
 care I'm still disappointed but I care  
 why because I use a concerned tone and  
 before I'm so disappointed in you my  
 hands are out defense you get defensive  
 I'm so disappointed in  
 you look at my hand so I can change  
 human behavior by my body language and  
 my tone and I use the same exact words  
 are you with me okay let's start to  
 learn how to do this this is where the  
 fun the ball game begins all right any  
 PQ connection questions this is where  
 you're going to learn how to take the  
 focus off you immediately and get it  
 onto your prospects and start to get  
 them into results based thinking over  
 price or cost based  
 thinking  
 now let me give you a few different  
 examples there's a lot of other  
 connection questions you'll have to  
 learn just going to give you a few  
 examples let's say  
 um I know each of you have like  
 different ways you guys do this but  
 let's say they're they booked an  
 appointment they've come in and you're  
 the case manager and you're sitting down  
 with him could that happen with a lot of  
 you okay how am I going to get them  
 instead of like hey how's it going today  
 I'm so excited you're  
 here how do I do this okay so let's say  
 you got their file would you kind of  
 know a little bit about them before they  
 came in most of you do some of you okay  
 okay so it looks like you uh booked with  
 this about looking at ways to I guess  
 get rid of the numbness in your feet so  
 you can feel comfortable walking again  
 right  
 right and what did I just do  
 there okay so it looks like you uh you  
 came in about looking at ways to get rid  
 of the I guess some of the numbness in  
 your feet to kind of walk again  
 right whatever I just do if that's what  
 their thing they put on the paper was  
 like they have numbness in their feet  
 whatever it is I'm repeating it back  
 because of  
 why I'm associating them being there  
 with what the end result what is the end  
 result get rid of the numbness in the  
 feet so they can walk again what did I  
 just do I get them right at this top  
 into what results based thinking rather  
 than price or cost based thinking see  
 how I can start doing this from the very  
 beginning now let's say that then you go  
 through your stuff they come in you're  
 meeting with them you're the  
 chiropractor I'm just going to give you  
 an example okay so hey when you were out  
 there um talking with Mary what was it  
 that you guys kind of went over that  
 caused you to you know want to look into  
 this further well the reason why I'm  
 here is because of and what am I  
 starting to  
 do what am I starting to  
 do get them to tell me why they're here  
 but more importantly who are they  
 telling themselves  
 and this is where they start to persuade  
 themselves that they want to change your  
 situation there's more that you got to  
 learn after this but this is just the  
 start going to give you a few more  
 examples now let's say I could do this  
 okay yeah and and John let's say I'm the  
 case manager yeah and John I mean today  
 might even be boring for you it's it's  
 really more for us to understand kind of  
 what you've done in the past to to treat  
 the headaches and you know the results  
 you've gotten from that compared to you  
 know completely getting rid of them to  
 kind of see what that Gap looks like  
 what did I just  
 do some of you didn't even know what I  
 just did let me do it  
 again okay why would I downplay them  
 being there why be like I'm so excited  
 this is going to be a great conversation  
 why would I downplay  
 it why would I down Jeremy what are you  
 talking about why would I downplay  
 it what's my ultimate goal what do I  
 have to do to get the prospect to  
 emotionally open up to me  
 get them to what let their guard  
 down when you up playay in a sales  
 situation what does the average Prospect  
 do downplay when I downplay they up  
 playay this is mismatching Behavioral  
 Science 101 okay I want to downplay so  
 they up playay I want to let their guard  
 down if I can't get them to let their  
 guard down there's no emotion there's no  
 sale see what we're doing here okay now  
 uh now watch what I did with my hands  
 did you see what I do with my hands oh  
 all right it's kind of you know for us  
 to really understand kind of you know  
 what you've done in the past let's say  
 if they have headaches I don't know to  
 treat your headaches and kind of the  
 results you've been getting from that  
 where's my hands results you been would  
 I want results you've been getting from  
 that no results you've been getting from  
 that compared to where you're wanting  
 them to be as far as getting rid of the  
 headaches what did I just do what did I  
 just start creating their  
 brain a gap  
 see how my body language influences  
 their  
 thoughts do you want to learn how to do  
 this this is basic I'm sh you results  
 you're getting from that compared to  
 maybe where you're wanting them to be to  
 get rid of the headaches to kind of see  
 what that Gap looks like and then  
 towards the in of today if you feel like  
 hey this might be what you're looking  
 for we can talk about you know uh  
 possible next steps would that help you  
 no would not help me to talk about  
 possible next steps they're all going to  
 say yeah why would I use the word might  
 be what you're looking for we can talk  
 about possible next steps why not be  
 like and towards the end here if you  
 feel like this is a good fit for you and  
 we feel like you're a good fit for the  
 program we'll show you how to get  
 started fair enough fair enough surface  
 level why not assume do you know why a  
 types are going to do what well I'm just  
 still looking around I didn't say that  
 I'm ready to do anything yet and what  
 did you just  
 trigger sales resistance now the up oh  
 just ch yourself in the foot but if I  
 just put in the words might be what  
 you're looking for see this is the  
 beginning towards the end I can be more  
 assumptive I don't have trust or  
 credibility in the first three minutes  
 right if they don't know me might be  
 what you're looking for we can talk  
 about possible next steps I  
 neutralize and I never get any  
 resistance the guard stays down would it  
 be easier just possibly easier to sell  
 if the prospects just had their guard  
 down every single time you talk to them  
 probably right all right let's keep  
 going here we're just starting here now  
 situation questions how do we help them  
 find out what the real situation is  
 because if we can't help them find out  
 their real situation how do we build a  
 gap to where they want to be if they  
 don't know where the heck they're at now  
 that could be trouble right how do we do  
 that all right let me give you some  
 examples  
 here now this my situation questions are  
 all going to be different based off what  
 why they're there right we're not going  
 to ask cookie cutter situation questions  
 if they're there for chronic headaches  
 we're not going to be asking about  
 numbness in their hands or feet well  
 maybe we are we'll see okay okay so I  
 see here on the Forum that you had  
 mentioned that you might be having some  
 issues with like numbness in your feet  
 can you tell me a little bit more about  
 that what do those little periods what  
 do those dots do see those little dots  
 in between this you're like Jeremy that  
 is not proper grammar I never listen to  
 anybody that does not do proper grammar  
 spelling be Nazis why would I have  
 little periods there it's an example of  
 what's called verbal pausing see a lot  
 of you what what if I ask these  
 questions this fast I see here in the  
 Forum you mention you might be having  
 some issues with numbness in your feet  
 can you tell me a little bit more about  
 that yeah just have some numbness and  
 stuff and just been noticing it for a  
 while see you say the question so fast  
 they have no time to internalize what  
 you're asking that's why you get surface  
 level answers because you're not giving  
 them time to think through what you just  
 asked but if I go okay so I see in the  
 form you had mentioned that you might be  
 having some issues with like pain I  
 guess like in your lower back um can you  
 can you tell me a little bit more about  
 that see I'm verbal pacing the question  
 out what does that do it causes the  
 prospects to internalize and think  
 deeper about what I'm asking now that  
 does what they start to what go below  
 the surface that's where our emotions  
 are see what we're starting to do here  
 then I can keep going now besides the  
 the lower back pain what what other  
 symptoms are you are you having to deal  
 with what type of tone did I just use  
 there concern why my tone is how the  
 prospect interprets the intention behind  
 the question so besides the lower back  
 like what other what other symptoms are  
 you having to deal with now Mary feels  
 what that I'm  
 concerned for her pain and if she feels  
 that I'm concern for her pain not just  
 trying to besides the lower back what  
 other Simpsons are you dealing  
 with flat tone monotone tone nothing  
 concern tone now she feels what that I  
 care for her  
 and she starts to build what with me  
 trust do you see what we're doing here  
 there's so much more to this okay but  
 how how frequently are you how  
 frequently are you getting the fatigue  
 though oh I'm getting it blah blah blah  
 blah blah so let's say that they start  
 telling me how long they've been doing  
 this  
 now can I role play with one of you here  
 real quick we're going to run out of  
 time  
 going to run out of okay here we go it's  
 touchy one here can we role play you're  
 really good at role play do we have a do  
 we have a mic here right here in the  
 front okay are you a chiropractor case  
 manager no what are you I am a laser  
 technician at the neuropathy Clinic H  
 would you know like all these  
 answers um sure who would okay you Kyle  
 thank you thank you thank case manager  
 perfect Kyle okay Kyle can you be a  
 patient quick now I'm not like a car  
 breor so I'm not like really educated in  
 all this even though we train okay could  
 be could be could be trouble okay so  
 just just roll with me okay okay so I  
 see in the form here you you mentioned  
 you might be having some issues with  
 like numbness in your feet can you can  
 you tell me a little bit more about that  
 yeah you know just over the last couple  
 years actually when it started I just  
 kind of was like just kind of feels  
 funny how do you mean feels funny well  
 it was just different kind of like I'm  
 walking on a watered up sock all the  
 time different yeah you know just like  
 I'm walking on somebody else's feet like  
 they're not my  
 feet what how do you mean by that just  
 so I understand well so okay just like  
 right now I'm standing it feels like  
 there's a sock but if I took my shoe off  
 there's nothing wrong okay and then how  
 besides the blah blah blah blah blah  
 what other symptoms are you dealing with  
 with that well I can't shower with my  
 eyes closed you can't what I can't  
 shower with my eyes closed and what else  
 well my golf game sucks but how often do  
 you typically golf though like before  
 the issue what's that how how often were  
 you golfing before the the  
 nness three four times a week oh you  
 were yeah okay and how how long have you  
 stopped having a golf though how long  
 ago kind of started lying to my buddies  
 about a year ago oh a year ago that long  
 yeah okay so you've been having to to  
 deal with the the numbness and the feet  
 for the past year I mean besides the the  
 golf cuz that's just fun you know um has  
 it had a has that had a impact on you  
 yeah in what way yeah uh my German  
 Shepherd suffers because I can't walk  
 her as much really yeah what  
 else well when you say she suffers what  
 do you mean well she's not getting  
 exercise no so nobody's walking her nope  
 okay let's just stop okay  
 so good what am I doing there you're  
 like why is he talking about the dog why  
 is he talking about the golf why doesn't  
 he focus on the physical pain what am I  
 doing  
 what I'm starting to find out what the  
 pain is preventing him from being able  
 to do okay now that's just the start of  
 it okay let's keep going here I'm going  
 to show you some other things here cuz  
 it gets more now we're going to skip  
 these probing questions we're going to  
 have  
 time now problem awareness questions so  
 now that we've there's other situation  
 questions you have to ask but now that  
 we understand what the real situation is  
 and more importantly they understand the  
 real  
 situation how do we build a gap and help  
 them find problems they didn't know they  
 had because if you could only help them  
 find one  
 problem are they likely to buy whereas  
 if I'm able to help them find two or  
 three or four or five of their problems  
 they didn't realize they had who was  
 more likely going to get that sale well  
 I will every time because even if they  
 figure out like well I mean this one  
 problem's not that bad but then you've  
 got boom boom two three four five other  
 problems in their mind they're like I  
 have no choice I have to I have to  
 change okay so how do we build the  
 Gap I'm going to give you a few examples  
 here look at this so I after I get in  
 this and it's all my problem Orest  
 questions are not going to be cookie  
 cutter right it's going to be based off  
 what they told me in my situation  
 question  
 so I mean you've been on XYZ medication  
 for the last 12 months I mean what's  
 caused you to feel like it's not going  
 to get rid of the repeat back the  
 problem why would I do something like  
 that if they're on medication why would  
 I ever say that you've been on XYZ  
 medication the last 12 months I mean  
 what's caused you to feel like that's  
 not going to get rid of the numbness in  
 the feet well the reason why it's not  
 going to get rid of the numb seeds is  
 because of this because of this because  
 of this and what did I just eliminate  
 from them what did I just eliminate in  
 their  
 mind that if they go back to that  
 they're never going to  
 what be healed because sometimes you  
 lose people and they say what well I  
 just you know I'll keep hoping that it  
 the medication's going to work see how I  
 prevented that objection coming up later  
 by how I worded the question what about  
 this so how do I pronounce that word the  
 G word Dr gab Gaba what yeah so we have  
 lots of clients in your space and I  
 interviewed a few of them like yeah put  
 the Gaba what oh he knows Nick how the  
 hell do you know Gaba  
 Pinon see you  
 know how was the number how is the  
 number one salesperson in all four  
 industries that I sold in in my 17-year  
 career and I can tell you I never even  
 knew how most of the products or  
 Services  
 worked  
 wow because I wasn't selling that I was  
 selling the results of what the products  
 and services did for them and that's  
 what I knew I don't need to know all the  
 technical features okay let's keep going  
 so you've been on so you've been on Gaba  
 Penton with your doctor the last two  
 years I mean what's caused you to feel  
 like that's not going to get rid of the  
 numbness what do my tone sound  
 like concerned well the reason why it's  
 not going to get rid of is here's  
 another one so let's say you're they  
 walked in and they've been seeing  
 another chiropractor what objection  
 would I want to prevent them going to  
 back to the other chiropractor some of  
 you lose people to other chiropractors  
 don't you you want me to show had to  
 stop doing that obviously it hasn't been  
 working if they still have the problem  
 so I mean you've been using ABC  
 chiropractor the last four years I mean  
 they're  
 they're fairly decent I mean what's  
 caused you to feel like you might want  
 to look at someone  
 else what did I just do  
 there why would I say I mean they're  
 fairly decent why wouldn't I say they're  
 great why wouldn't I say they  
 suck they're horrible because a lot of  
 times they'll get defensive well I mean  
 they're not that they're not bad but if  
 I say I mean they're fairly decent what  
 do my tone just  
 seed  
 doubt see how I basically just told them  
 that the other chiropractor  
 sucks by my tonality and they never get  
 defensive do you see what I'm doing it's  
 all in my tone they're fairly decent I  
 mean what's caused you to feel like you  
 might want to look at someone else well  
 I mean I like Dr gabber but I'm just  
 having problems with this and he doesn't  
 seem like he's blah blah blah blah blah  
 and now I just prevented what them from  
 ever going back they're going to be here  
 this is easy stuff once you learn the  
 right skills okay here's another one I  
 might ask now I'm not going to ask this  
 question if I ask the other first one  
 I'm going to ask and probe and clarify  
 so I mean are you let's say they have  
 been to another car pror so are  
 you  
 100% satisfied with the results you've  
 been getting so are you  
 100% satisfied with the results you've  
 been getting what tone did I just use  
 what kind of concerned slash kind of  
 skeptical why would I do  
 that why would I use that tone what is  
 that seed in their  
 mind doubt why would I use a 100% why  
 not say are you satisfied with the  
 results you've been getting why would I  
 use  
 100% you know why because no one likes  
 anything  
 100% think about the dream C what's your  
 dream car that you bought your best car  
 you've bought you're like I love this  
 car can you speak up Chevy Camaro I  
 don't yeah you love that car the first  
 day you're down the road you found stuff  
 you didn't like think about the person  
 you're dating or married to or whatever  
 the first couple months were blissed  
 they are perfect angels of God and  
 within 6 months you're like God there's  
 some things I don't like  
 see if I don't put 100% in there that  
 backfires no one ever say yes I'm 100%  
 satisfied with the results that's why I  
 walked in  
 here they'll like here's what they do  
 here's what they do they'll do this well  
 I mean I wouldn't say 100% not 100% what  
 don't you like not 100% they always say  
 well I mean I wouldn't say 100% not  
 100% see what I'm doing I'm shifting  
 their thought process  
 okay let's keep going here all right  
 solution ress questions how do we get  
 them to see what the future looks like  
 once the new found problems are solved  
 okay there's a lot of other questions my  
 concern is you're going to take six  
 questions I gave you and come back like  
 Jeremy I didn't triple my Revenue this  
 year well yeah I just gave you a few  
 nibbles here I don't have time they're  
 kicking me off the stage and well it  
 says 11 minutes but I bet they let me go  
 15 okay so here we go how would it how  
 would it be different though like you  
 you being able to get rid of the the  
 chronic headaches I mean how how would  
 your life be I don't know like  
 maybe maybe different than it is now  
 though why would I slow that question  
 down how does it sound when I do this  
 how would it be different though youve  
 been able to get rid of the headaches  
 how would your life be maybe different  
 than it is now John oh I don't know it  
 probably be  
 good too fast surface level answer how  
 would it be different though I mean you  
 you being able to get rid of like the  
 the the headaches like how would your  
 life be I don't know like how would your  
 life be  
 maybe maybe different than it is  
 now what did I just caus them to do  
 think deeper about the question I'm  
 getting them to internalize that's where  
 the emotional side  
 is you learn how to do this physical  
 pain has only gotten you here emotional  
 pain gets you here I can assure you of  
 this let's keep going  
 here  
 now then when they say they're like oh  
 it would be good I'd be able to golf I'd  
 be able to walk my German Shepherd I'd  
 be able to do  
 this can I ask a favor I'm out of water  
 can I get half hot water here and uh  
 like half lukewarm  
 \[Music\]  
 water thank you okay now then I'm going  
 to say okay but they're going to say oh  
 we do this or do that okay but what  
 would do for you personally  
 though logical based question first  
 they're going to tell me logical I walk  
 the dog that's my girlfriend give her a  
 round of applause thank you  
 I I'd walk the dog so when I ask a  
 logical based question they're going to  
 give me logical answers I'd golf more  
 I'd walk my dog I'd do this but that's  
 still what logical things on how their  
 life would be different but then I'm  
 going to lean in and I'm going to be  
 like okay but being able to to to do  
 those things um what would it do for  
 you  
 personally oh my gosh it would relieve  
 so much stress stress oh you have no  
 idea the stress this is causing  
 me  
 done I don't need to do anything  
 else because they've told themselves  
 what what the future looks like once  
 they can do everything they've ever  
 wanted and all the stress and pain are  
 gone  
 but if I can't get them to open up  
 emotionally I get what at the end sounds  
 really good I just need some time to  
 think about it  
 what your your hand's about to fall off  
 dude you want to think it over see okay  
 let's keep going here now let's keep  
 going how would you respond to this  
 anybody ever get this anybody ever get  
 an email or a call and they're like we  
 really liked you and what you had to say  
 but we just decided to now it's not a  
 good time  
 we we we need to wait for the treatment  
 uh we'll get back to you when we're  
 ready keep in touch raise your hand if  
 you've ever heard something like that  
 you're like what you're you chronic  
 headaches you can't even go to work what  
 are you talking about how would you  
 respond would you throw out a rebuttal  
 tell them why they're wrong how often  
 does that work not one out of 50 so you  
 keep doing it right it's like golf you  
 get one good swing out of 100 so you  
 keep going to golf cuz you think it  
 works right but that's the numbers game  
 approach what if if we played the skills  
 game what if I could get it to work nine  
 out of 10 times and I said this by using  
 an NQ consequence question I call him  
 back I'm like hey Mary I got your got  
 your email that's not a problem um you  
 know you can always come back later can  
 I  
 um can I can I ask you something though  
 sure yeah what's going on um how can  
 I communicate to you that  
 you that you might be making a  
 mistake without you getting upset with  
 me  
 uh sure yeah what do you have in  
 mind what did I just do  
 there no one will ever say no I'm upset  
 with you that I that you said I might be  
 making a  
 mistake per upet can I um can I ask you  
 something sure go ahead how can I  
 communicate to you that you that you  
 might be making a  
 mistake without you getting upset with  
 me sure yeah what what do you mean then  
 I'm going to loop back around and I'm  
 going to ask a consequence question  
 because yeah I mean Mary from what you  
 told me I mean what happens if you don't  
 do anything about this now your nerves  
 get pinched  
 off and they have to  
 amputate well I I never really thought  
 about that I mean do you I mean do you  
 want to have to go through all that and  
 all the complications that come after  
 that if  
 you if you didn't have to well no if I  
 didn't have to but I just don't know if  
 it's just  
 expensive well in  
 reality which is more  
 expensive I mean is it more expensive  
 for you to get the funds together and we  
 take you through the treatment and your  
 you know your feet get  
 saved and you're able to walk around and  
 spend time with your grandkids the next  
 30 Years or is it more  
 expensive if you don't do anything right  
 now and your nerves get  
 pinched and they  
 amputate and you're in a wheelchair the  
 rest of your  
 life I me in  
 reality which is more  
 expensive what tone did I just  
 use and how does she interpret why I  
 asked that  
 question does she interpret that I'm  
 just trying to make a sale and make  
 money or does she interpret that I'm  
 genuinely concerned about the major  
 implications and consequences of what  
 happens if she doesn't do  
 anything and if she feels that I am  
 concerned and genuine and I've built  
 that Gap that trust and the pain of the  
 emotions what do you think is going to  
 happen nine times out of  
 10 she's going to get in the treatment  
 plan and you then become a problem  
 solver and you change the woman's life  
 forever however on the flip  
 side if you don't learn  
 this and she says  
 no her life goes into a different  
 direction and who's responsible for that  
 we are this is why  
 communication is the most important  
 thing you can learn if you really want  
 to solve your people's problems because  
 if I can't communicate to them they  
 don't buy and I can't help them  
 is that why you got into what you're  
 doing  
 now okay now we've got a few minutes  
 left now anybody want more questions  
 like that I don't have a lot of more  
 time they are going to yell at me I've  
 only got four minutes which really means  
 nine in my  
 mind love it I know I get thrown off  
 every stage um I'm going to give you a  
 QR code I'm going to give you what's  
 called the NQ blackbook of questions  
 this is our updated version we're  
 releasing it in 3 days it's 161 Pages  
 the old one was 8 give a lot of  
 different industry specific examples I  
 think some of them for you guys as well  
 I'm going to give you the the QR code  
 I'm going to give you 10 seconds 10 9 8  
 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 now you have to take a  
 picture of me because when you this is  
 the only way I can get this to you when  
 you join this group this is one of our  
 free Facebook groups sales Revolution  
 there's like 110,000 some people there  
 maybe more now I'm not sure when you get  
 in there you need to message a picture  
 of me take a picture of me  
 now this is your code word if you don't  
 have this picture you will not get the  
 book I'm going to give it to you for  
 free I told Dr GB and his team I would  
 this is your you got to take a picture  
 of me you don't get if you don't have  
 the picture that is your passcode you're  
 like I saw Jeremy this weird guy with  
 the two parts on his hair I don't know  
 why he does that on stage and I want the  
 black book you message me in there  
 somebody on my team will message you  
 back it won't be me I like 20,000  
 messages a day some my team will message  
 that we'll give it to you for free that  
 help you start okay now I've got a few  
 more things step three oh my God Jeremy  
 step three I got five minutes how do we  
 eliminate sales resistance where the  
 prospects let their guard  
 down this is the most important thing  
 you can ever learn in your life it's  
 about neutralizing the hidden pressure  
 that you're having in your conversations  
 that you don't even know with pretty  
 much every Prospect you're talking to  
 anybody ever heard of this anybody ever  
 watched this movie  
 put that coffee down coffee's for  
 closers  
 right ABCs a closing that's what average  
 salese do you don't want to be  
 average selling is not adversarial it's  
 not you against the prospect trying to  
 win them over so you make money that  
 will only get you this far you want to  
 be at the top selling's collaborative  
 you working with the prospects to help  
 them find and solve problems they didn't  
 realize they had now we're going to  
 teach you start here in the next 4  
 minutes the abds of selling that stands  
 for always be disarming no more always  
 be closing now do I mean that when that  
 patient's there I get to the end and be  
 like well uh I guess email me back if  
 you're interested that ain't going to  
 help you okay we have to learn how to  
 get them to commit to take the next step  
 to solve their problems by purchasing  
 what you're offering but we have to  
 disarm them now how do we do that you  
 ever get this objection can you just  
 tell me how much it's going to cost I  
 tell you if I'm interested anybody ever  
 get that raise your  
 hand  
 o what do you feel like you  
 said or didn't ask or how you use your  
 tone that triggered them to say that to  
 you bet you never thought about that H  
 now we have three choices when we get  
 this  
 objection we can do this we can do this  
 tell them the rate without build a gap  
 it's going to be this when you do that  
 in the first 3 minutes how many of them  
 like wow that's great 15,000 I'm  
 in what do they  
 say that's just a lot of money I I'm not  
 sure boom gone done that probably is not  
 a good strategy second strategy sweep it  
 on the rug hope and pray they don't  
 bring it up I'm going to ignore it oh  
 yeah we'll go through that later now let  
 me ask you and then what do they do two  
 or 3 minutes after that hey just just  
 tell me and they get irritated cuz you  
 just lost what trust cuz they know  
 you're hiding it don't do that it's not  
 good or we can do this answer it  
 indirectly where it makes sense while  
 we're asking I didn't mean to make that  
 bad face at you I think I think I made a  
 bad face it was not meant to you that  
 was meant to me I don't want to offend  
 you okay I I saw that like that was a  
 really bad face I made there what was  
 going  
 on okay all right so here's what we're  
 going to do we're just going to agree  
 with them oh yeah for sure I mean we'll  
 go through all that for sure I mean it's  
 really all going to depend on like the  
 results of your thermal picture you know  
 that's going to show us the the kind of  
 blood flow you're getting into your foot  
 uh you know the results of your  
 neuropathy test and and really you know  
 what your xrays look like as far as like  
 you know structural changes like any  
 disc damage and and once I can see all  
 that and understand all those details I  
 can go through all the different options  
 we have for our clients would that help  
 you if I did that for you no it would  
 not help  
 me yeah sure and now it makes sense why  
 I'm what asking the questions does it  
 depend on all those things if that's  
 their  
 issue how can you tell them the price  
 when you don't even know  
 what see what I'm doing there okay see  
 how easy I just got them to do what let  
 their guard down if I can't let their  
 guard down they stay surface level I get  
 tons of objections most of the time I  
 lose the sale if I can let their guard  
 down I don't lose the sale okay how  
 about another one anybody ever get this  
 objection sounds really good this is the  
 last one actually I'm out of time should  
 I get off the stage before I show you  
 how to overcome this one oh  
 Cliffhanger oh right it's like the you  
 know the episodes of like you guys were  
 watched uh 24 when it first came out  
 like the you know the lost and  
 everything you get to the end you're  
 like I got to go to bed  
 3:48 Monday night okay I'm going to  
 watch one  
 more I always say this one for last I  
 mean how nobody wants to kick me off  
 here oh it sounds really good but I just  
 need to think it over now is I want to  
 think it over an  
 objection is it do they leave your  
 office and go home and they're like I  
 really need to think this through let's  
 see um let me get the Excel spreadsheet  
 out and I'm going to type in like if I  
 you if I had these chronic headaches for  
 one month 3 month my disability payments  
 like I need to really think this  
 over when you tell a salesperson you  
 want to think it over do you go back  
 home and think through it really  
 seriously for the next 3 to 6 weeks no  
 you just had a concern and you didn't  
 want to tell them so you just you wanted  
 to make them feel good right that's what  
 they're doing to you so I have what's my  
 job to do here I have to find out what  
 the real concern is how do how do I do  
 that by getting them to let their guard  
 down and tell me oh you guys are good  
 you're good this is fun so I'm going to  
 do this oh yeah yeah not a problem uh  
 what's your time frame on getting back  
 to me in the next day or two just to see  
 if I'll be available for  
 you Jeremy what are you doing you're  
 you're not trying to overcome the  
 concern oh I am but how can I let how  
 can I get them to let their guard  
 down if they think it's over and we're  
 setting up another appointment what  
 starts happening to the  
 guard starts to come down cuz we're  
 about to leave he or she's about to  
 leave the office right oh yeah not a  
 problem what's your what's your time  
 frame on getting back to me in the next  
 day or two to see if I'd be available  
 for  
 you why would I say just to see if I'd  
 be available for you what does that do  
 does that raise my status that maybe I'm  
 busy I've got lots of clients see I'm  
 raising my status by how I'm positioning  
 it there a lot of people are like well I  
 could call you back next week I could  
 I'm not sure waffle don't let them do  
 that cuz they don't what they don't call  
 you back in a week do they surprise  
 surprise well possibly not sure if I'd  
 randomly be available like that with my  
 client's schedule um what I can do if  
 you have your calendar handy I can pull  
 up mine and have you book a specific  
 time with me that way you don't have to  
 chase me down and vice versa would that  
 help  
 you what did I just do with my  
 status that way you don't have to Chas  
 face me down see who has the problems I  
 don't have the problems the prospect has  
 the  
 problems why why are you qualifying to  
 the prospect when they're the ones that  
 have the problems you're the one that  
 can what solve the problems so you're  
 going to start learning how to get the  
 prospects to qualify to you because  
 you're the one that solves the problems  
 right they're okay let's say we book a  
 time they're coming back on we're going  
 to talk on the phone on  
 Tuesday not so fast CU I need to find  
 out what their concern is now hey um be  
 before you go what were you um what were  
 you wanting to go over in your mind just  
 so I know what questions you'll have  
 when we talk on tuesday well you know  
 it's just a big decision and I'm just  
 not sure we have the money for  
 it what did I just find out it's a money  
 concern and oh I'm right there in front  
 of them now I know the concerns so what  
 I can what can I do now help them  
 overcome the money concern and get them  
 into the treatment  
 program instead of saying what do you  
 need to think  
 about they well I just I have to think  
 about big decisions defensive yeah what  
 was it that you were wanting to go over  
 in your mind just so I know what  
 questions we'll have when we talk  
 again well I just don't know if this is  
 the right treatment plan because my  
 doctor says that this doesn't  
 work see that's the real concern because  
 if you couldn't help them tell you what  
 the real concern is were they going to

\# Secrets To Mastering Your Tonality  
\# https://www.youtube.com/watch/2yPjnNeFCnQ

 do you ever notice when you ask  
 questions to your prospects you think  
 they're good but they give you vague  
 generalized surface level answers you  
 ask a question like yeah yeah you ask  
 another question well I I don't know  
 they're just kind of vague there's a  
 reason why that's happening and it all  
 has to do with you know what it's going  
 to sound kind of crazy but your tonality  
 because your tone is how your prospect  
 interprets the intention behind  
 everything you say and every question  
 you ask that's how they interpret why  
 you're asking the question in the first  
 place now I'm going to show you today  
 come over here to the vibe board here L  
 Vib board.com doing a sponsorship du  
 with you guys pretty soon there's five  
 types of tone there's many types of tone  
 but there's five main types of tone if  
 you want to become a top 1% salesperson  
 in your industry okay or if you're a  
 company that's wanting to scale like to  
 become the market leader and stay on top  
 everybody else you've got to master  
 these five types of tone you've got a  
 conf confused tone Jeremy why would I  
 sound confused I have to sound like the  
 expert all the time well I'm going to  
 show you in certain context when you  
 have a confused tone it actually  
 triggers your prospect's brain to say oh  
 he didn't understand what I meant by  
 that I need to clarify that better oh  
 and we get them to open up emotionally  
 I'm going to show you how to do that  
 here there's a tone you've got to learn  
 how to have a curious tone okay you got  
 to have to learn how to have a  
 challenging tone in certain aspects  
 you're not going to have a challenge ing  
 tone in the first two minutes of a  
 conversation with a prospect and you  
 have zero trust or credibility I'll show  
 you when to do that you're going to have  
 a concern tone a tone that shows more  
 empathy in certain context and sometimes  
 you need a playful tone Oh my gosh what  
 am I going to do with you playful tone  
 I'll show you what I mean by that as  
 well now the most important part when I  
 train you this because I'm going to show  
 you some industry specific questions and  
 how to shift your tone based on the  
 context to trigger different emotional  
 drivers in your prospect's mind get them  
 to let their guard down oh you might  
 want to learn this if you want to sell  
 more now the really important part here  
 is I'm going to show you I want you to  
 pay attention to my facial expressions  
 and my body language when I use  
 different tone because your facial  
 expressions are the remote control  
 they're the remote control to how your  
 tonality comes across you can't have a  
 confused tone and your face is like this  
 like with no movement okay watch your  
 favorite act or actress in a movie  
 you're going to notice that their facial  
 expressions are changing their tonality  
 if I have to if I want to challenging  
 tone and I'm sitting here what if you  
 don't do anything about like I can't  
 have a challenging what happens if you  
 don't do anything about this see my  
 facial expression causes my tone to  
 change and shift I'm going to show you  
 to do that all right let's get in here  
 all right the first thing I'm going to  
 show you right here and I'm also going  
 to show you how to do this this is an  
 example of what we call neq verbal  
 pacing most most of you the reason why  
 you get a lot of surface level answers  
 from your prospects is because one the  
 questions you ask now I realize it's not  
 your fault you were trained that way but  
 it is your what it is your problem right  
 so a lot of times when you ask questions  
 you ask them too fast and the prospect  
 has no time to internalize what you're  
 asking so they just give you a knee-jerk  
 reaction so I have to slow the question  
 down I have to have what's called verbal  
 pauses in between certain words that  
 cause the prospect to hang on to every  
 single word I'm about to say as an  
 example of verbal posing okay all right  
 so let's say if you sold uh let's say  
 you sold for a marketing agency I'm just  
 going to show you some random examples  
 here all right this is an example of  
 what's called an  
 neq problem awareness question so look  
 at this okay so I mean you've been with  
 XYZ company for the past five years I  
 mean they're they're fairly decent I  
 mean what's caus to feel like they're  
 not going to be able to help scale you  
 now what did I just do there did a few  
 things here I'm going to show you okay  
 now what type of tone I actually use two  
 types of tone it's kind of a confused  
 tone slash concern like I'm confused I  
 don't understand they're fairly decent  
 what's caused you to feel like you might  
 want to look at someone else now that  
 question causes them to do what tell me  
 but more importantly tell themselves why  
 the they're with is not going to be able  
 to scale them or why they're looking at  
 different companies right so it's like  
 I'm kind of pushing them away to get  
 them to pull me back in but look at the  
 tone if I said it like this so you've  
 been with XYZ company for 5 years I mean  
 they're fairly decent what's caused you  
 to feel like there's not going to be  
 they're not going to be able to scale  
 your business well you know we just I'm  
 not sure we just always want to look  
 around see it's too fast of a question  
 there's no tonality I'm not changing  
 their my my emotions to trigger their  
 emotions okay and I'm saying so fast  
 they don't have any time to internalize  
 it but pay attention to how I do it  
 again so I mean you've been with you've  
 been with XYZ company the last five  
 years I mean they're they're fairly  
 decent I mean what's caused you to feel  
 like they're not going to be able to  
 scale your  
 company see concern see how I end it  
 with a concern tone remember if my tone  
 is how the prospect interprets the  
 intention behind the question they feel  
 that I'm concerned for them not being  
 able to scale now the first part I'm  
 like confused I'm not understanding now  
 why does a confused tone work in this  
 context okay I'm not saying you have a  
 confused tone like uh you're in the  
 presentation like uh I don't know how it  
 works I I'm not sure what we do I'm  
 confused like obviously you're not going  
 to be confused like that but that type  
 of confused tone okay I mean you've been  
 with XYZ company what's caused you to  
 like you're you're not understanding now  
 what happens is in their brain their  
 subconscious mind I'm a well I went to  
 college for Behavioral Science I do know  
 a little bit about the brain but their  
 subconscious mind does there at that  
 point is it says oh he didn't understand  
 what I meant by that I need to clarify  
 that better oh he didn't understand why  
 I'm looking around for something else I  
 need to explain that better I need to  
 clarify that if our whole point of the  
 conversation is get the prospect to what  
 open up emotionally if I can't get them  
 to clarify and tell me their pain relive  
 the pain they don't feel any need to  
 what change and if they feel no need to  
 change that's why you get so many  
 objections that's why you lose sales you  
 could be making you see where I'm at  
 okay that's a confused toone now let me  
 show you a crazy thing I did here why  
 would I say fairly decent why not say oh  
 the company you're with is a really good  
 company well that's not going to help  
 you but it's also not going to help you  
 to say yeah that company sucks they're  
 horrible because a lot of times well  
 they look at you like well of course  
 you're going to say that you're you're a  
 salesp person you're biased right but if  
 I'm like well I mean they're they're  
 fairly decent what did I just see there  
 with my tone that's almost like a like a  
 concerned skeptical tone that I might  
 know something about the company they're  
 with they don't know that's not very  
 good but I'm not I'm I'm not saying it  
 because I don't want to you see what I'm  
 doing well they're fairly decent see I'm  
 automatically seating what in that  
 prospect's brain I'm seing doubt see how  
 I can see doubt by not telling them how  
 bad the company uh their with is but I  
 se it strictly by my tongue you might  
 want to pay attention all right I got a  
 bunch more here let's say uh this is an  
 npq problem or this question let's say  
 I'm a real estate agent and I'm trying  
 to get a listing okay now let's say I  
 knock on the door okay or no just say I  
 have an appointment I've knocked on the  
 door let's say I'm knocked on the door  
 or called lead or whatever and I'm into  
 the conversation this is not going to be  
 the first question you're going to ask I  
 mean  
 I mean Susie I mean your your home is is  
 I mean it's a really beautiful home I  
 mean what's caused you to feel like you  
 might want to sell  
 it well I mean it's a beautiful home but  
 the reason why we want to sell it is see  
 what am I doing there that confused SL  
 concerned tone causes that homeowner to  
 tell me why they want to sell but more  
 importantly who do they tell they're  
 telling themselves why they want to sell  
 which is more persuasive you telling  
 them why they should sell or them  
 telling themselves why they should sell  
 I think you know the answer when they  
 tell themselves it's their idea not  
 yours that's how you eliminate people  
 like buying something from you and then  
 when you leave because you pressured  
 them they you're gone now that pressure  
 wears off and they decide to cancel okay  
 so when you learn these type of  
 questions with this type of tone it  
 causes the prospect to pull you in let  
 me show you a bunch of other examples  
 let's say if you sold life insurance I  
 mean I could show this for every  
 industry on the planet even yours we  
 train your industry as well I mean let's  
 say if you sold life insurance and you  
 find out they already have a 100K work  
 policy well I know if I sell life  
 insurance that if if I don't get them to  
 tell me why that's not going to be  
 enough I might get an objection at the  
 end like well I mean we do have the work  
 life insurance policy maybe we'll look  
 at this later so I've got to eliminate  
 that from their brain I mean I mean John  
 you guys have this 100K work policy I  
 mean what's caused you to feel like  
 that's not going to be enough well I  
 mean it's a good thing but I mean it's  
 it's not going to be enough because I  
 mean you know our bills are this and and  
 they start explaining to themselves why  
 that's not going to be enough now if I'm  
 selling life insurance and they and I  
 can get them to tell me why whatever  
 they have is not enough that's probably  
 a good thing for you to sell them more  
 life insurance which they need anyways  
 oh let me show you another example here  
 I can show this for every industry let's  
 say if you're a door too salesperson all  
 right we train a ton in this space as  
 well this is an example of what's called  
 an any PQ pattern interrupt now what do  
 most salese do that knock on the  
 door hi are you the homeowner here yeah  
 I'm the homeowner um yeah hey I'm uh my  
 name is Jeremy Miner I'm with XYZ  
 company and we're out here in your  
 neighborhood your prospects aren't even  
 listening past that point because you  
 know what just happened salesperson  
 trying to sell me something and they go  
 into fight ORF flight mode protection  
 mode it's a defensive mechanism do you  
 ever get that if you sell door to door  
 where they're like hi my name is I'm  
 with XYZ company the reason why we're  
 out in here neighbor is oh not  
 interested solar not interested alarms  
 not interested oh piss control we  
 already have that oh lawn care service  
 we already have that whatever it is not  
 interested they don't even hear what  
 you're saying because your tone sounds  
 like everybody else so I need to  
 interrupt the pattern to trigger  
 curiosity okay I learned how to do this  
 my first job was selling home security  
 systems door to door became the number  
 one rep in the nation actually very very  
 quickly as a college student because I  
 learned how to pattern interrupt all  
 right I did have an advantage I was  
 learning Behavioral Science in college  
 so I learned all this stuff so when they  
 knocked on the door first of all I  
 wouldn't look like a salesperson I even  
 had a construction vest on the orange  
 one or the lime green one the grandpa  
 shoes you know the old white balanced  
 new balanced uh White Shoes like the  
 Grandpa's wear you know I had like just  
 the khaki shorts I just didn't look like  
 a salesperson so when I knocked on the  
 door had like a clipboard here and  
 everything like I was had like a piece  
 of paper with five or six questions I'd  
 be looking around like if I sold Roofing  
 I'd probably be looking at the roof if I  
 sold solar might be looking at the roof  
 too for panels if I sold Pest Control  
 might be looking at the ant Ms in the  
 yard or looking out in the yard or the  
 cobwebs for spiders you see you're  
 you're looking like you're not a  
 salesperson you don't to be like this so  
 I'd be to the side like six seven feet  
 back they'd come to the door and I'd be  
 like yeah are you guys the um are you  
 guys the the property owners here they  
 be like yeah we're the we're the owners  
 what's going on pattern interrupt I just  
 interrupted the pattern and triggered  
 massive curiosity strictly by using a  
 confused tone and verbal pacing and  
 verbal pausing are you starting to get  
 it all right now if you want to uh more  
 of this type of stuff here's my  
 suggestion if you end up subscribing to  
 this channel I'm going to give you a  
 word of advice do not share this Channel  
 with people you compete with so if  
 you've got a buddy or a friend that  
 sells for a competing company you  
 probably don't want to share this  
 Channel with them because you don't want  
 them to learn what I'm going to show you  
 now if you want to share it with other  
 people that are in a completely  
 different industry that you don't  
 compete with by all means share it with  
 it but he subscribe don't share with  
 your friends if you compete with them  
 you don't want them to know this stuff  
 okay you will have a competitive  
 advantage over them for sure all right  
 verbal pauses let me show you to do this  
 most of you have been taught this hey  
 let me ask you a question what do you  
 use now for and you just bulldoze you  
 like let me ask you something and then  
 you ask it okay I'm going to show you  
 how to change this where you trigger  
 massive curiosity this is another  
 example of a pat interrupt using a  
 curious tone now can I um can I ask you  
 something uh sure what's going on can I  
 um can I ask you something curious tone  
 prospects hanging on to every word now  
 when I ask them the question like oh my  
 gosh what's he going to ask me see what  
 I'm doing there I'm triggering curiosity  
 by using my tongue now another thing  
 that you have to learn is what's called  
 verbal cues verbal cues are important  
 when you're asking questions if you  
 don't want to sound like a scripted  
 robot would I suggest you don't want to  
 sound because prospects as you know if  
 you sound script it sounds like you're  
 interrogating them like an FBI agent  
 they do what hey you know enough with  
 the questions can you just tell me how  
 much it's going to cost not tell you if  
 I'm interested so you're triggering that  
 from your tonality and not knowing how  
 to bridge from question to question so  
 verbal cues are like ah but how long  
 have you had that issue with the  
 XYZ uhhuh okay but before that happened  
 what were you guys doing about actually  
 solving the ABC problem oh you did but  
 what did your boss do when you said that  
 to him and then at that point what it  
 happened see I'm verbal queuing from  
 question to question ah but what  
 happened when you see the verbal Q comes  
 right before the next question because  
 most salese do what they ask a question  
 the prospect answers and then they pause  
 two seconds they're like okay cool  
 gotcha gotcha uh let me ask you or okay  
 yeah awesome uh I'm curious John and you  
 sound like a scripted robot you sound  
 like a salesperson okay so I have to  
 right ah okay interesting really right  
 now I'm not doing that right in a  
 row okay but when that  
 happened what did your boss say to you  
 at that point oh they did how long has  
 that been going on on for oh it's been  
 going on for 5 years so since that's  
 been going on five years has that had a  
 has that had a impact on you well in  
 what way though see I'm bridging from  
 question to question what bridging does  
 is it makes the conversation sound so  
 natural the prospect just their guard  
 never comes up because they feel like  
 they're talking to their best friend or  
 their grandpa or their uncle or their  
 mom or dad the guard stays down because  
 they feel it's a natural  
 conversation it's a natural conversation  
 but it's a very structured and skilled  
 conversation they just don't know and it  
 keeps them on the right track all right  
 so let me give you an example of a  
 playful tone you're probably like why  
 would I need a playful tone Jeremy that  
 makes zero sense what are you talking  
 about you crazy guy all right now  
 playful tone is typically used when you  
 want to get the prospects guard out okay  
 so let's say I get on Zoom I have an  
 inbound appointment um and let's say  
 what in this example well it could be an  
 example let's say I'm on zoom and the  
 prospect gets on there and they're like  
 hey how you doing today what would you  
 say you be like Oh I'm really doing good  
 I'm working hard you know just helping  
 people drinking lots of coffee now  
 that's not bad it doesn't hurt you but  
 it doesn't really help you what can I do  
 to get them to emotionally start to open  
 up and humanize that conversation and  
 get them to let their guard down I'm not  
 going to make standup comedy jokes you  
 probably don't want to do that because  
 you probably are not a standout comedian  
 but like hey how you doing Jeremy oh you  
 know just hanging out being boring over  
 here what about you what are you doing  
 oh I'm sure you're not being boring see  
 what I just did there oh you know just  
 hanging out being the boring guy what  
 about you oh gosh I'm sure you're not  
 boring now if I didn't use a playful  
 tone check out how it sounds oh you know  
 just hanging out being the boring guy  
 over here what about you whoa you are  
 kind of boring that's awkward but my  
 playful tone triggers a different  
 emotion that Prospect spring oh you know  
 just hanging out being the boring guy  
 what about you you being boring over  
 there oh gosh I'm sure you're not boring  
 Jeremy guard goes down more trust right  
 see how I kind of pushed them away they  
 pull me back in now let me give you  
 another example oh how you doing today J  
 oh you know just trying to stay out of  
 trouble what about you you get in  
 trouble over there John oh I'm sure  
 you're not a troublemaker no I'm always  
 in trouble you know my wife told see  
 guard goes down because of the playful  
 tone now let's say what if you're boss  
 BD use a cheer I wish I was bald I'm  
 like if I would been bald I you know I  
 could have sold more oh you know just  
 surfing the web looking for a better  
 hairspray what about you  
 oh yeah you know when my uncle went bald  
 we used to make fun of him all the time  
 guard goes down now that's if they can  
 see you you wouldn't say that if they  
 can't see you because it wouldn't make  
 any sense see I can do this with  
 anything let's say if I'm on with the  
 Prospect and uh I'm like uh and they  
 don't turn on their Zoom if I'm on an  
 inbound appointment a zoom appointment a  
 calendar leader or whatever and they  
 won't turn on their Zoom I get on there  
 like I I can't um uh can you hear me  
 yeah and hey I'm having a hard time  
 seeing is your video broken no I just uh  
 you know I don't like to turn my video  
 on well what's going on over there it's  
 3:30 are you still in your pajamas Sandy  
 oh no I'm not my pajamas a lot of times  
 they'll just turn it on right there see  
 lower guard playful tone all right you  
 see what I'm doing there okay let's keep  
 on going here all right now how do you  
 have a curious tone let me show you the  
 difference with a curious tone okay so  
 let's say if I'm a lead broker and I'm  
 selling leads to a company or maybe I'm  
 selling leads to a real estate agent or  
 whoever right Network marketers so walk  
 me through what are what are you guys  
 doing now to to generate new leads and  
 clients see that's just a straight  
 curious tone the Curious tone causes the  
 prospect to interpret that I'm genuinely  
 curious that's why I'm asking the  
 question all right that's an example of  
 an npq situation question I'll give you  
 a couple more here now what about a  
 challenging tone when do you use a  
 challenging tone you can't really use a  
 challenging tone in the first couple of  
 minutes of a conversation why because  
 you haven't really built any trust or  
 credibility but halfway through three4  
 of the way through that conversation I  
 built a gap from maybe where they are to  
 where they want to be I've helped them  
 relive their pain of the problem and see  
 what the future looks like once the new  
 found problems are solved future pacing  
 let's say if I sold Staffing I I work  
 for Staffing or recruiting agencies and  
 I recruit uh you know let's see  
 operations people or sales people or  
 marketing people for companies and the  
 companies obviously pay you for that  
 okay so I might uh find out that this  
 company I'm trying to get a contract  
 with to recruit employees for them that  
 they're having a lot of flaky employees  
 that the current company they use for  
 Staffing is giving them a lot of like  
 really bad people for those positions  
 and they're just not doing their job and  
 they want to scale let's say to 15  
 million a month and they're at 10 right  
 now but these employees that're they're  
 hiring they're just not very good they  
 don't feel like they're going to take  
 them to that next level so I mean what  
 what happens if you don't do anything  
 about this and you they keep giving you  
 those flaky employees I mean how will  
 you guys get to 15 million a month  
 without the best people let me do it  
 again challenging T so I'm going to  
 start with a challenging tone up here  
 now why do I do that because once I get  
 him to see what the future looks like  
 with my solution awareness questions or  
 future pacing they feel it they see what  
 the future looks like once they have the  
 best people I want to rip that away from  
 them with the consequence question that  
 gets them to defend themselves on why  
 they need to change now which builds  
 more urgency for them to buy now not  
 later so what happens if if your company  
 what are the ramifications if your  
 company doesn't do anything about this  
 and they keep hiring these I think you  
 said flaky employees how how will you  
 guys ever get to 15 million a month  
 without the best people see challenging  
 tone and then at the end right here I  
 went down into a concern tone now why  
 would I switch to a concern tone here  
 because the concern tone that's how a  
 tone that shows empathy the concern tone  
 is how they interpret why I'm asking  
 this question that I'm  
 concerned that if they don't do anything  
 the problem stays the same and they  
 never get what they said they wanted  
 they generally feel like I'm concerned  
 for them about about the consequence  
 which triggers more trust they have in  
 you the salesperson see where we're  
 going with that trust is where the sales  
 made now concern tone where do we use a  
 concern tone okay so let's say the  
 prospect says this you know this is  
 causing so much pressure on me pressure  
 see I can repeat back the emotional word  
 anytime the prospect gives you an  
 emotional word pressure concerned  
 worried stressed frustrated anxiety okay  
 tension see those are all examples of  
 emotions so I want them to clarify that  
 emotion why would I want them to clarify  
 their emotions to me well every sales  
 made by every buying decision is based  
 on emotion not logic we all heard that  
 right brain studies prove that every  
 decision you make starts with your  
 emotion you feel like a drink of water  
 so I start I feel like a drink so I  
 start to make the decision with my  
 emotional side of my brain I feel like  
 watching a Tik Tok video so I pick up my  
 phone has nothing to do with logic do  
 you see what we're doing I feel like I  
 can't get to 15 million a month in  
 Revenue so I might need to talk with the  
 salesperson see every decision starts  
 with your emotional side of your brain  
 not your logic okay so look at what I'm  
 doing here so I just repeat back  
 pressure see I'm concerned the concerned  
 tone Oh my gosh yeah you don't know the  
 pressure that's been going on how long  
 has that how long has that been going on  
 for Barb see see my my hand on my chest  
 here that is a body language signal that  
 signifies that you are concerned for  
 their situation when they feel you're  
 genely concerned they start to trust you  
 more when the prospect trusts you more  
 they trust that you can get them the  
 best result they trust you right that's  
 how you build trust by your tone and the  
 questions you ask not by asking them who  
 won the game last night or talking about  
 their daughter who got married or what  
 their favorite dog is in the beginning  
 or how their days going those are just  
 predictable questions every salesperson  
 ask you're not building trust with that  
 quite opposite actually okay every  
 salesperson use it how long has that  
 been going on for see I'm concerned oh  
 my and they say oh it's been going for  
 five years that's been going on for five  
 years what what's it doing to you oh my  
 gosh the stress is enormous see what I'm  
 doing there concern tone okay or I could  
 use this question right here let's say  
 if I can't get them to move forward they  
 keep procrastinating I might I Le I  
 might lean in the final example what's  
 really holding you back from moving  
 forward see that concern tone but if I'm  
 like What's really holding you back John  
 from moving forward oh I don't know it's  
 just a big  
 decision what's really holding you back  
 from moving forward well Jeremy you know  
 to be honest with you well thank you for  
 being honest with me George see I can  
 trigger that emotion anytime a prospect  
 says you know just to be honest with you  
 you know what you want to say well thank  
 you for being honest with me I'd hope  
 you being honest with me you have to use  
 a playful Tone If you're like thank you  
 for being honest with me I'd hope you be  
 honest with me oh that's kind of like an  
 insult right but I'm like well thank you  
 for being honest I hope you be honest  
 with me what did I just do I just also  
 seated what that I'm honest by doing  
 that see what I'm doing there okay all  
 right hope that helped you you want to  
 subscribe to this channel like I said my  
 word of advice is this do not share this  
 channel where I train you this type of  
 stuff with anybody you compete with  
 because if you go up against them and  
 they start to learn this stuff week  
 after week month after month year after  
 year and you don't know it you're going  
 to compete with people you don't want to  
 compete with so I do realize you guys  
 like to share stuff like this only share  
 it to somebody that's in sales or  
 business that does not compete in your  
 industry hope that helped you today the  
 five types of tonality if you you master  
 tonality you can become well you can you  
 can make a lot more sales than you are  
 now and you get to help a lot of people  
 that's a cool thing so hope that helped  
 you today

 you know I'm thinking about switching  
 companies but I have a good comp plan  
 things are really really good so tell  
 me why should I go with your company why  
 should I go with you cuz we're the best  
 and the energy is real that we provide  
 why should I go with you like she said  
 we are the best we have the best people  
 the best company the best energy we're  
 the  
 best why should I go with you we have  
 the best people the best product and the  
 best community okay I want you three to  
 come up on stage with me right now okay  
 now if I asked any of your competitors  
 from other network marketing companies  
 if I asked them the same question if I  
 was was a Network marketer and you were  
 trying to recruit me into your  
 organization from another company and I  
 asked them the same question I asked you  
 why should I go with them what do you  
 think they would say probably the same  
 ah okay if I asked your competitors  
 anybody in this industry the same  
 question why should I go with them what  
 do you think they would  
 say probably the same thing that I said  
 the energy the people M the product  
 quality okay and if I asked your  
 competitors the same question why should  
 I go with them what do you think they  
 would say they would say that their  
 product is the best their people are the  
 best and that you need what we have to  
 offer okay so what I think I heard all  
 of you just say is that in your  
 prospects mind mind you all sound the  
 what the same you all sound the  
 same could that be a problem for  
 you okay all right I want you guys to go  
 sit down quick can I have the microphone  
 back okay now let me start off  
 asking you this  
 question if I asked you to  
 describe the word sales or  
 selling in one  
 word what would that word be if I should  
 describe sales or selling in one word  
 what would that word  
 be  
 persuasion  
 trust  
 Solutions value outstanding Rel  
 relationships lifestyle okay I like all  
 of that there was a few others that are  
 either our clients or have read some or  
 follow me somewhere so if I what if we  
 took all those words you just said CU I  
 agree with you what if we took every  
 word you just said and we wrapped it  
 into one word and that word was this  
 change you see all selling is all sales  
 are about one thing only and that's  
 change so whether your prospects are  
 wanting something better  
 or they're moving away from  
 pain it's all about  
 change so it's about how good you are at  
 getting your prospects to view that in  
 their mind that by them changing their  
 situation now for you that means what  
 purchasing what you're offering starting  
 the business with you that by them doing  
 that that is far less risky for them  
 than them doing nothing at all staying  
 in the status quo their problems stay  
 the same and nothing ever changes which  
 is more  
 risky now here's your problem though  
 human beings don't like  
 change think of what I just said here  
 all selling is is change yet human  
 beings do not like change and why do we  
 not like change well we especially do  
 not like change when it's initiated by  
 some pushy salesperson who's ready to  
 pitch their solution quickly in the  
 conversation and repeatedly human  
 behavior shows  
 that we value something that is familiar  
 to us even if we don't like it that well  
 compared to something that is new  
 something that is foreign to us  
 something that is unknown now raise your  
 hand if you know anybody friend family  
 business associate maybe even somebody  
 in the room that just complains about  
 the relationship to you all the time oh  
 my relationship is so bad he or she is  
 so horrible and they complain to you  
 about it all the time yet do you ever  
 wonder why they St stay in that  
 relationship even they though they don't  
 like it that  
 well well why is that because we're a  
 human being and we're afraid of change  
 see what I'm talking about so that's  
 pretty much what you're going up against  
 with pretty much almost every single  
 person you're talking to about your  
 business okay now to some extent now how  
 do we help them overcome the fear of  
 change it's quite easy Once you don't  
 step by that speaker it's quite easy  
 Once you learn  
 how so let's start here we're going to  
 keep it  
 basic realize this you are not selling  
 the  
 thing you're selling the results of what  
 that thing does okay in your industry  
 you're not selling them a water  
 machine you're selling them the results  
 of what that does for them you're  
 selling them the result results of what  
 happens when they start the business  
 with you you're selling them having more  
 time you're selling them on being Their  
 Own Boss you're selling them on making  
 more money that's what you're selling  
 the results of what your business  
 actually does for them not the thing  
 itself are you with me on that all right  
 let's keep going  
 here now I want to ask you this  
 question how are  
 you going to have a comp competitive  
 advantage over everyone else who's in  
 your industry there are tens of millions  
 of people throughout the world that do  
 the same thing you do do you realize  
 that you're not the only person you're  
 not the only company right everybody  
 else thinks they're the what the number  
 one the best they have the best this  
 they have the best that they have the  
 best quality they the best people they  
 have the best Founders they have the  
 best whatever they all say the same  
 thing so how do you stick out in your  
 prospect's mind okay so here's my  
 suggestion on how you can do that the  
 ones who will own when I say this  
 upcoming Market I mean the next year two  
 years 5 years 10 years the ones who will  
 excel the ones  
 who will make hundreds of thousands of  
 dollars a year if not Millions a year  
 are simply the ones that know how to do  
 this  
 the ones who know what to say and ask  
 that will cause their prospects to want  
 to open up to want to engage instead of  
 trying to get rid of  
 you that's simply what it will take okay  
 so what's going to give you that  
 competitive Advantage what's going to  
 cause you to stick out in your  
 prospect's mind the next three things  
 are so today I'm going to show you this  
 we're going to break down each one we  
 got a lot of time usually doing Keynotes  
 I have like 65 minutes or 90 minutes I  
 got to throw everything out I think  
 we're here for 6  
 hours we're slow  
 down seven seven hours okay I got to  
 catch my flight tonight all right so  
 today we're going to go over three steps  
 to becoming the trusted Authority in  
 your prospect's  
 mind trusted Authority trusted expert  
 how do you do that hold it all right  
 number one becoming a problem finder and  
 Problem Solver not a product Pusher  
 product pushers do not do very well in  
 our day and age especially in your  
 industry you will have to play the  
 numbers game and go through a lot of  
 rejection and I'm just too lazy for that  
 I'd rather not do that number  
 two asking the right questions but at  
 the right time in the conversation and  
 especially with the right  
 tone you see your tone is is how your  
 prospect  
 interprets the intention behind  
 everything you say your tone is how your  
 prospect interprets the meaning behind  
 the questions you're  
 asking there are certain questions that  
 you're going to have to ask that require  
 more of a curious  
 tone uh what do you do for work what do  
 you do what do you do for a living  
 that's a curious tone there's other  
 questions that require more of a a  
 confused tone John hold on I'm I'm not  
 understanding why did they why did they  
 cut your pay see that's a confused tone  
 there's other questions that require  
 more of a skeptical or challenging tone  
 what are the consequences if you don't  
 do anything about this see that's a  
 challenging tone there's other questions  
 that require more of a concern tone a  
 tone that shows more  
 empathy Sally what's what's really  
 holding you back from moving forward so  
 you can make more money see that's a  
 concern  
 to and then  
 third is eliminating sales resistance  
 how do we eliminate sales resistance to  
 get the prospect to let their guard down  
 and emotionally open up and tell us  
 what's really going  
 on all  
 right now what I'm going to  
 do  
 whoa I'm going to I'm going to give you  
 a little bit of my  
 background yes that is an old picture  
 it's like 22 years ago see how it's all  
 faded and everything they had like like  
 cameras back then or something I don't  
 know if the phones even took pictures  
 back then so I'm going to go over a  
 little bit of my background because my  
 background relates to what is necessary  
 if you want to take your income and your  
 persuasion and sales ability to a level  
 that most people only dream of so I got  
 started in selling 22 years ago broke  
 burned out college student and I got my  
 first job selling home security systems  
 door to door raise your hand if you ever  
 sold anything door to door I know my  
 people now okay let me Zone in on you  
 okay and basically the company most door  
 to door companies they hire you it's  
 straight commission they pretty much  
 hire everybody they give you a script  
 they give you a couple books by the  
 sales gurus and they drive you out in a  
 van let me know if you've ever  
 experienced this in door to door they  
 drive you out in a van and they  
 basically like kick you out of the van  
 and they're like hey go make some sales  
 it's going to be easy we'll pick you up  
 after dark and I'm like I'm a  
 21-year-old kid and I still remember the  
 last one dropped off in that van I still  
 remember looking back at my sales  
 manager his name was exan a crazy name  
 he like a surfer guy from California his  
 crazy like curly blonde hair and he's  
 like Yo dude remember when you knock on  
 the door show them how excited you are  
 about the product show them that you  
 believe in the product and that you  
 excited be enthusiastic and they're  
 going to be excited they're going to  
 believe it if you show them your belief  
 in it I'm like that makes complete sense  
 if I show them I'm excited about it if I  
 show them that I believe in it then  
 somehow they're magically going to  
 believe in it too and so I started  
 knocking on the I started knocking on  
 the doors you know and I was all excited  
 and I was talking about my features and  
 my benefits and how was the best this  
 and we were the number one this and we  
 were the local company who had the best  
 quality and the best service and we had  
 a AAA rating with the Better Business I  
 was really  
 excited and I started noticing from the  
 very first store that I was getting all  
 these  
 objections what they didn't tell me  
 about all that we don't need it we can't  
 afford it your price is too high we've  
 already talked with somebody about this  
 I need to talk with my spouse I need to  
 do more research I need to think it over  
 can you leave me information I'm really  
 interested I'll call you back and a week  
 a month a year later raise your hand if  
 you've ever lost sales to any of  
 those few of you back there have not  
 lost any  
 sales that's remarkable back there and I  
 finally got to a point after about seven  
 to gez eight weeks of  
 hell I'm going through that non-stop  
 rejection I finally got to a point where  
 I'm like this is not very fun and I  
 remember one late Friday evening about  
 to be picked up from the sales manager  
 remember standing there on the curb  
 sweat rolling down my chest you're  
 talking like end of July early like end  
 of June early July heat sweat rolling  
 down your chest your back if you've ever  
 sold door to door after like 12 hour  
 days your legs are what Jello like  
 they're toast like your legs are G I  
 still remember like rubbing my foot on  
 the hot concrete if you've ever sold  
 door to door you you know that's an  
 inside story  
 and I had worked 12 hours that day and  
 made zero sales so when you make zero  
 sales and your door to door and a  
 straight commission that means what oh0  
 oh no good in fact that entire week I'd  
 work 60 plus hours and made zero sales  
 0 and I remember thinking you I'm  
 feeling pretty defeated as a human  
 being and I and I I thought to myself  
 you know maybe  
 selling maybe selling just wasn't for  
 me have you ever felt that way  
 yourself have you ever like looked into  
 your bank account and notice you had  
 more going  
 out than you had coming in yes well  
 that's where I was at completely  
 desperate and when my manager picked me  
 up that day he popped in a Tony Robin CD  
 yes 22 years ago people listen to those  
 like round things called the CDs you you  
 plug it it's just really miracle and  
 Tony said something like  
 this he said  
 this I could be butchering it Tony if  
 you're listening but he said you will  
 fail for the simple reason you don't  
 learn the right skills necess necessary  
 to succeed you will fail if you don't  
 learn the right skills necessary to  
 succeed now he went on to say that  
 everybody is pretty much taught  
 skills but he said the people who do not  
 do as well who who don't succeed are the  
 ones who are not taught the right ones  
 and he goes on to say that there are  
 differences in skill level and for the  
 first time in my 21-year old life I was  
 thinking oh I I never knew that some  
 skills maybe were far more effective  
 than others that maybe what the company  
 was training me and what I was learning  
 from what I call the old sales gurus no  
 pun  
 intended maybe they just weren't the  
 right skills anymore maybe they're  
 outdated maybe they didn't just work as  
 well so I committed to myself that I'm  
 going to well I'm going to have to learn  
 how to do this I'm going to have to  
 develop I'm going to have to learn the  
 right skills  
 because I know you like me want to  
 provide a great last St for your family  
 as well is that the reason why you're  
 here okay now at the same time this was  
 going  
 on same time I was using traditional  
 selling skills so you know from the  
 gurus from the the company what they  
 were training me and I would notice  
 there was this major dilemma going to  
 mind CU I noticed when I would use some  
 of the things they were training that  
 they would work and I would make some  
 sales but I also noticed a lot of times  
 I used some of the things they were  
 saying I would actually lose a ton of  
 deals I noticed when I would say certain  
 things and I would be more assumptive  
 especially in the beginning it was like  
 my prospects would like close down Y and  
 I'd get more objections and I'd have to  
 chase and I'd have to follow up with  
 them all of the time and it was almost  
 like I was begging them to solve their  
 problems with my solution it was like I  
 I noticed that when I would ask  
 questions they would give me vague  
 generalized surface level answers raise  
 your hand if you've ever noticed  
 that now the same time this was going  
 on I was in college and I was majoring  
 in Behavioral Science and human  
 psychology and I'm not going to give you  
 the scientific mumbo jumbo you might get  
 bored but really Behavioral Science is  
 the study of the brain and how we make  
 decisions why does the brain say yes  
 instead of saying no why does it look at  
 a sign that says go go left and actually  
 go left like what triggers that to  
 actually happen now my Behavioral  
 Science  
 professors while I was in  
 school they were saying that the most  
 persuasive way to communicate was over  
 here now one of my uh one of my  
 professors was by the name of Robert  
 calini anybody ever heard of Robert  
 calini I know Colton we were talking  
 about it okay he's head of Behavioral  
 Science at Arizona University uh wrote  
 persuasion power of influence some of  
 those great books and also other  
 professors that I was learning from they  
 were saying that the most effective way  
 to communicate was here now the sales  
 gurus in their training programs they  
 were saying it was here talking exact  
 opposite so like there's this thing of  
 like what should I do I don't know who  
 to believe like what's going on so I'm  
 like how do I take what I'm learning  
 from how the brain makes decisions human  
 behavior psychology social Dynamics how  
 do I take that and bring that into a  
 stepbystep sales structure because that  
 didn't exist at that time how do I learn  
 the right questions to ask so what I  
 started to  
 do was started to learn how to develop  
 questions and techniques that worked  
 with human behavior how do I use my tone  
 that get them to let their guard down  
 how do I get them to do all the work  
 instead of traditional selling you've  
 got to do all the work right how do I  
 get the prospect to sell themselves  
 whereas traditional selling you've got  
 to sell them how do I get them to  
 persuade themselves how do I get them to  
 overcome their own objections how do I  
 get them to pull me in rather them push  
 and pressure and  
 overnight selling became very very easy  
 and exceptionally profitable  
 now why did I just tell you my story and  
 background  
 because none of you care about  
 that you're a human right we all are  
 that's just human behavior one one who  
 do you care about you care about  
 yourself right but why did I tell you  
 all that because I want you to imagine  
 me four years from that date that I was  
 on getting into that van about to  
 quit 4 years later from that very time  
 I was making multiple seven figures a  
 year in commissions four years later  
 four years before I almost quit all  
 because of what because I had not  
 learned the right skills now I went on  
 to do that in four completely different  
 Industries one of them in your industry  
 so I know your industry fairly well yes  
 you  
 see I I am  
 not anyone  
 famous in fact I'm a lot like  
 you I'm just simply a person who decided  
 very early on that if I wanted to have  
 an amazing lifestyle for my future  
 family that I was not going to be able  
 to do what everyone else was doing I was  
 not going to be able to stay in the  
 status quo if I wanted to sell a lot  
 more I couldn't sell like everybody else  
 was with traditional selling skills I  
 was going to have to learn a much more  
 advanced way of selling to get a much  
 better result you see unfortunately for  
 me I was not born out of my mother's  
 womb with Advanced questioning skills  
 raise your hand if you're born out of  
 your mother's womb with Advanced  
 questioning skills oh just this one guy  
 here two okay you see oh three see I was  
 four five oh wow you you definitely had  
 advantage over me I wasn't born out of  
 my mother's womb with Advanced tonality  
 skills and I for sure was not born out  
 of my mother's womb with Advanced  
 objection prevention and handling  
 skills I had to acquire those skills I  
 had to learn those  
 skills so if a kid who grew up in the  
 the middle of Missouri on a cattle ranch  
 outside of a town with less than 800  
 people in it can acquire those skills  
 what does it mean for  
 you it means you can do the exact same  
 thing you can make 2 3 5 10 20 50 100  
 times what you are currently making now  
 you guys are okay with that all  
 right  
 so when somebody  
 says that salese are  
 born we all know now that that's what a  
 myth no one is born with any of those  
 skills we have to acquire those skills  
 okay let's move on now how do we do that  
 it's all talk it's all dreaming until we  
 do what we acquire the  
 skills  
 now  
 step number  
 one becoming a now I have to warn  
 you I have dry eye syndrome so my  
 puncture plugs are closed so if I'm  
 cheering up I could be crying more than  
 likely I have punct SHP plugs in my in  
 my eyes so I always have to warn anybody  
 when I speak if I'm crying I it could be  
 but there you go all right becoming a  
 problem finder Problem Solver not a  
 product pusher  
 now raise your hand if the prospects you  
 talk  
 to have problems and or emotional needs  
 raise your hand everybody better be  
 raising their freaking hand you see  
 there's never been a product or service  
 ever invented in the history of mankind  
 that does not solve a problem and or an  
 emotional need your industry does both  
 you have an advantage AG now if I buy a  
 $500,000  
 Ferrari does that really solve a problem  
 I mean if I'm a race car driver maybe  
 but it doesn't really like if I want to  
 go from point A to point B I can drive a  
 2012 Honda Accord right but that car  
 probably does what solves an emotional  
 need maybe when I was a kid I was maybe  
 I was bullied and now I'm really  
 successful and I want to show my High  
 School classmates 25 years later that  
 I've arrived that I'm successful I'm  
 solving emotional need maybe my dad said  
 I wouldn't amount anything so now I'm  
 going to show him I'm going to have a  
 really nice car maybe I want to impress  
 my neighbors that I drive through see  
 I'm solving an emotional need everything  
 that has ever been sold solves a problem  
 and or an emotional need so here's what  
 I'm going to have you do on a pen grab a  
 pen and a piece of paper I'm going to  
 give you 35 seconds not a second more  
 and I want you to write down the two  
 biggest problems write down the two  
 biggest  
 problems that you solve that could be  
 through your product or your business  
 write down the two biggest problems that  
 your products and services solve you  
 might want to all write that down  
 because I'm going to come ask some of  
 you write down the two biggest problems  
 that you solve with the business or your  
 products somebody rais their hand that's  
 already written that down right there  
 yeah health and finances health and  
 finances okay uh yellow money and time  
 money and time yes you uh dreams vision  
 and Mission bigger than the life that  
 they're living and looking for a sense  
 of belonging and support as an  
 entrepreneur valid okay yes um answer to  
 Chronic health issues and a vehicle to  
 creating generational wealth without  
 golden handcuffs okay good those are all  
 problems emotional needs that you solved  
 now here's my suggestion as someone  
 coming from your industry that did  
 fairly decent made a few dollars the two  
 biggest problems that you really  
 solve that you probably want to focus on  
 if you want to build big organizations  
 and help a lot of people is a lack of  
 money and a lack of  
 time those are the two biggest problems  
 that you solve lack of money lack of  
 time  
 now how many  
 people do you even even know in your own  
 circle of influence or business  
 associates or people walking down the  
 street or neighbors or anybody that want  
 to make more money or have more time  
 with their  
 families okay everyone see everybody in  
 the  
 world is a potential customer for you  
 when you start viewing it from a  
 different  
 Viewpoint everybody in the world except  
 maybe about the 900 some  
 billionaires want to make more money  
 well actually they want to make more  
 money and they want to have more time  
 okay those are the two biggest problems  
 that you solve  
 now here's what I'm going to ask  
 you look at the two problems you just  
 wrote  
 down raise your hand if your solution  
 solves  
 us everybody should be raising their  
 hand I can see if you're not I'll  
 probably come to  
 you I have Vision all over the place all  
 right all right so here's here's what I  
 here's what I feel you're saying to  
 yourself your prospects have  
 problems and your solution solves  
 those so if your prospects have problems  
 and your solution solves  
 those why are they not buying from  
 you what's the missing  
 link they have problems they want to  
 make more money they want to have more  
 time your solution solves those why are  
 they running running the other  
 way can I make a suggestion to you  
 okay  
 okay here's what I'm going to suggest to  
 you it's not the people you're talking  
 to it's not the leads even though a lot  
 of you think it is oh my leads are broke  
 they have such a limited limiting belief  
 they just have a  
 fear everybody I talk to is broke  
 it's not your  
 mindset even though some of you believe  
 it  
 is can I say something that might sound  
 really harsh right  
 now okay I'm just being real with you  
 because if I'm not real with you I'm I  
 can't really help  
 you it's not that you don't have a great  
 mindset or that you don't Journal enough  
 or you don't take enough cold showers  
 or you don't meditate enough even though  
 I love those things none of those things  
 are going to help you communicate to  
 your  
 prospects it's not that you don't even  
 read enough personal development even  
 though I love personal  
 development because when the prospect  
 says  
 hello if you don't know what to say if  
 you don't know what to ask if you don't  
 know how to use your tone you're going  
 to get slapped in the face very very  
 quickly and all that that personal  
 development is going to go out the  
 window extremely  
 fast even though I love personal  
 development it's not going to help you  
 sell  
 more it's not that you're not motivated  
 enough you're all motivated you came  
 here that tells me and you what that  
 you're serious about changing your  
 situation otherwise otherwise you'd be  
 at home watching football or you know  
 doing something else shopping and it's  
 damn well that you don't work hard  
 enough raise your hand if you work hard  
 raise your hand if you work hard see you  
 all work hard I know lots of people in  
 this industry that work their butts off  
 that are still making no hardly any  
 money so if it's none of those  
 things what on Earth could it actually  
 be now before I suggest you what it  
 could be I want to ask you this  
 question raise your hand if you want to  
 Triple the amount of sales you made last  
 year and or triple the amount of people  
 you bring into your organization and  
 business raise your hand even if you're  
 starting out and you're brand new and  
 you're like as a brand new person you  
 haven't even done anything but you want  
 to Triple what the average brand new  
 person is raise your hand now keep Your  
 Hand  
 raised if you can triple the amount of  
 hours you're working right now keep Your  
 Hand raised if you can triple the amount  
 of hours you're working  
 now you already work 8 to 10 hours a day  
 you're going to work 16 to 24 to well  
 you can't go past 24 you're going to  
 work 16 to 24 hours a day come on let's  
 be  
 real you can't that's not going to last  
 even if you try  
 right so if it's none of those things  
 what is it it's  
 this if you want to Triple your sales if  
 you want to Triple the amount of people  
 you bring into your organization and  
 then show them how to actually be  
 successful and  
 duplicate you have to what you're going  
 to have to acquire a much higher level  
 of sales ability than you currently  
 possess  
 today  
 right okay now it's what you're saying  
 it's what you're not asking it's words  
 you're using that's triggering sales  
 resistance that's once you learn how to  
 tweak those words words and how to use  
 your  
 tone everything can open up for you and  
 that's what we're going to focus on  
 throughout this day now I'm going to ask  
 you this question as well who in here  
 raise your hand if you like to read  
 books raise your hand if you're a reader  
 okay or you listen to books on audio  
 maybe you're drive around your car  
 that's what a lot of us do right the  
 first sales seminar that I ever went to  
 was by a a guy by the name of Brian  
 Tracy raise your hand ever heard of  
 Brian Tracy yeah good friend of mine um  
 first seminar I ever went to after that  
 Dreadful Summer Okay first sales seminar  
 I went to and Brian said something  
 that's stuck in my brain ever  
 since Brian said this he said use your  
 vehicle as a university on Wheels and  
 from that when I when I saw him standing  
 on this type of stage in Salt Lake City  
 Utah in September of 2001 yes I'm that  
 old when I was in school  
 that changed my entire  
 direction from that moment on I turned  
 the radio off and I started listening or  
 reading to Five Books a month times 12  
 months a year that's 60 books a year on  
 sales persuasion and influence times the  
 past 22  
 years if I did my math right that's  
 1,360 some books now a lot of people ask  
 me Jeremy how do you have time to read  
 five books a month I don't I typically  
 listen to three and I typically read to  
 two now where do I listen to Three well  
 there's a thing called a car that you  
 drive  
 around so instead of listening to Taylor  
 Swift even though I love you Taylor or  
 listen to your favorite songs maybe  
 you're into heavy metal or country or  
 raer whatever you listen to or how many  
 of you listen to politics or the news  
 not  
 this because how many of those things  
 you listen to right now in your  
 car how many of those things I just  
 listed make you  
 money zero none of them make you a dime  
 and look at all the time you're  
 wasting 3 minutes here 5 minutes here 10  
 minutes to the grocery store 7 minutes  
 to church 7 minutes back to church 10  
 minutes to pick up your kid 10 minutes  
 to come back home 10 minutes to work  
 there's an hour and a half probably a  
 day that you could acquire the skills  
 and some of you say you don't have  
 time probably not this group  
 though now in every single book I've  
 ever read or you've probably ever read  
 there's usually two things it says  
 usually says always be closing ABCs of  
 closing that's kind of a given that most  
 have invoke and it also says you have to  
 be a problem solver and I agree with  
 that but as I really started to think  
 about what problem solving meant problem  
 solving does not happen until after they  
 purchase you can't be a problem solver  
 if they don't buy your product or start  
 the business with you right how can you  
 be a problem solver if they don't  
 purchase from you you can't you see  
 problem solving happens after they buy  
 after they have the machine after they  
 start the business with you and you're  
 training them what to do for your  
 industry so if you want to bring a lot  
 more people in the you are  
 if you want to make a lot more sales you  
 have to become much better at this this  
 is what's called problem finding now  
 what does problem finding actually mean  
 problem finding is asking the right  
 questions at the right time in that  
 conversation to get the prospect to see  
 and feel that they have many more  
 problems than they originally thought  
 they had now when you first start  
 talking with a potential customer or  
 Prospect most of them don't know what  
 that they really even have a problem am  
 I right yeah if you start talking to  
 them about your machines I'm assuming  
 I'm going to go out on a limb that they  
 don't set right on Sunday afternoons  
 really diving into like how bad the  
 water is that they drink just going to  
 go out and a limb on that okay they  
 might say they want to make more money  
 or have more time but they don't really  
 sit around having some plan about how  
 they're going to do that right am I  
 right on that okay so if we can't get  
 them to understand  
 that so we have to help them see that  
 they have many other problems challenges  
 they didn't didn't know they have okay  
 now when we do that when we're able to  
 help uncover problems in their mind that  
 they didn't know because most of your  
 prospects probably know they have a  
 problem especially making money and have  
 time but they don't really know what how  
 bad that problem really is they don't  
 understand the depth of that problem  
 they don't understand the consequences  
 of what happens if they don't do  
 anything about solving that problem  
 now through learning and we're going to  
 we're here all day through learning  
 Advanced  
 questioning and  
 probing and tonality and body  
 language that allows the prospect to  
 start seeing many other issues and  
 problems they had never really  
 internalized themselves that causes them  
 to build urgency in their mind that they  
 want to what is that word again  
 change okay all right let's keep moving  
 on let slow this down a little bit now  
 what are most salese and Distributors  
 unfortunately most sales and  
 Distributors are  
 this am I  
 right I mean let's be real some of you  
 don't believe you're this and it's not  
 your  
 fault that you were maybe train this but  
 it is your what it is your problem it's  
 not your fault but it is your problem  
 problem and nobody's gonna save you but  
 who yourself nobody is coming to save  
 you okay now what are most salese or  
 distributors in your industry trained to  
 do if I well let me ask you this I've  
 got a I got a Dandy for you it's all  
 coming back to me now it's like riding a  
 bike if I'm driving down the  
 road and I'm with my friend and and my  
 friend says oh God I hate my job  
 freaking sucks company just went through  
 a merger I get fired they're just not  
 paying me that much so sick of this like  
 never get to see little suie you know  
 piano recital I know you see Johnny  
 playing  
 soccer your friend says that and then  
 what do you say just be real just be  
 real what do you  
 say oh thats you know what I just  
 started this amazing opportunity it is  
 so awesome like I know some people that  
 are making so much money and they work  
 from home in fact we have this machine  
 it's like this machine that like gets  
 rid of disease and like we get to you  
 know drink the water and like oh the  
 water is so bad for you in fact like  
 when I found out about the water it was  
 like oh my gosh I can't believe the  
 water like uh just the plastic water and  
 and everything and like you know what  
 there's a webinar tonight you should  
 definitely come it's so cool like  
 they're going to go over like the how  
 bad the water really is that you're  
 drinking and it causes all the disease  
 and they're going to go over like this  
 income opportunity and in fact my mentor  
 she's making $60,000 a month that is so  
 insane it's so awesome so I'm going to  
 email it to you and then after you go  
 through it um will you call me and I'll  
 I'll take you through the details and  
 how to sign up is that you do something  
 like that  
 oh product  
 Pusher and then your friend says what oh  
 yeah I'm really busy tonight like yeah  
 you know is it is it does it cost money  
 is it one of those like MLM type of  
 things because my aunt she started one  
 of those saying a couple years ago she  
 lost all of her money like a pyramid  
 scheme and she got scammed so I just  
 don't have the money but thanks so  
 much and then you're left  
 like she had the  
 problem Your solution solves those  
 problem what was the missing  
 link what you're saying what you're not  
 understanding how to  
 ask how to get them to emotionally open  
 up and relive the pain before you go  
 into your  
 pitch that's what caused her to run the  
 other way even though she has problems  
 that you really can help and that's the  
 sad thing see where we're at here this  
 is real life  
 if we can't help somebody overcome the  
 fear of change who is that on them or us  
 it's on us and the moment you start  
 taking  
 responsibility if you don't bring  
 somebody in that you start a talk to  
 like and you start think like what did I  
 say what did I what did I not ask like  
 was I was I too fast to jump in and you  
 start to internalize it rather than  
 saying just a numbers  
 game just talk to as many people just  
 got to get as many what what's the  
 saying in network  
 marketing for the NOS to get to the yes  
 what is it for no go for no what what's  
 the other one closer to yes no get  
 closer to yes there's other ones the  
 cliches uh well I know what you're  
 talking about but there's there's the  
 other ones it's like oh it's like uh so  
 what who cares  
 what's what is it somebody stand up what  
 is  
 it some will some won't who cares next  
 yeah  
 that's exactly why you're not where  
 you're at  
 financially sounds really good it's a  
 cool  
 cliche but it's not really helping you  
 is it unless you really love playing the  
 numbers game giv you an excuse what if  
 we worked on and started playing the  
 skills  
 game what if we focused on every word  
 we're saying every question we're asking  
 and not asking and how to use our tone  
 and we focused on every every the  
 quality of every conversation we're  
 having do you ever watch any movies or  
 does anybody ever watch like the NBA you  
 know like Steph Curry anybody knows  
 Steph Curry everybody Heards of Michael  
 Jordan all those LeBron Tom Brady can  
 you imagine Steph Curry he's like the  
 three-point guy right oh yeah can you  
 imagine can I set this  
 here is that like vodka or what is that  
 yeah Lord jeez what's going on up here  
 this is a VIP table apparently I like  
 that can you imagine if Steph Curry said  
 that basketball was a numbers game oh  
 just shoot as many threes as you can I  
 mean eventually you'll hit one out of 25  
 just a numbers game just keep shooting  
 it you'll eventually hit  
 one would Steph Curry be in the NBA no  
 he would have never made his high school  
 team see Steph Curry knows that  
 basketball is a Skills game so he's  
 focused on his technique every day he's  
 practicing his hand motions his  
 dribbling right his legs his his hips  
 how he gets open his movement his wrist  
 and that's why he's become the best  
 because he's focused on the skill game  
 whereas so many of you are still focused  
 on the numbers game so good can I help  
 you with that okay all right now let's  
 keep  
 going let's keep moving on and here's  
 what I oh I have to say this some of you  
 might get  
 angry so when we go through what I just  
 did out there with all that stuff you're  
 talking to your friend we got all this  
 stuff right we're get all excited  
 enthusiastic we have the best this we  
 have the best that that is the  
 equivalent of like this taking a bucket  
 of  
 mud throwing it up against the wall and  
 hoping and praying that something you  
 just said in that two-minute whatever  
 that was called is going to magically  
 cause that person to want to buy from  
 you and be interested from you we call  
 that  
 hopium it's a drug it's a drug that so  
 many entrepreneurs Distributors salese  
 take where you hope and pray something  
 you're going to show them in that  
 webinar is going to M that you're  
 inviting them to because the webinar  
 does the selling for you it's going to  
 magically cause them to want to buy  
 you'll get the laydowns but you're  
 missing the other 98% that still have  
 the same problems and the same  
 challenges that you could help as well  
 don't do drugs if you want to be a top  
 1% earner in this industry drugs are not  
 good for you don't take the hopium drug  
 anymore that is a hard way it's  
 unpredictable there's no way you can  
 make a living in this industry or any  
 industry for that matter taking the  
 hopium drve okay let's go to step number  
 two here we go all right step number two  
 asking the right questions at the right  
 time now  
 remember let's go back so remember I was  
 in college remember I was Major in  
 Behavioral Science human psychology the  
 study of the brain how human beings make  
 decisions so check this out according to  
 Behavioral Science there are three forms  
 of communication I think I even wrote  
 about these in that book three forms of  
 communication I would suggest that you  
 write these down because once you  
 understand the differences in Persuasion  
 and where you currently are even if  
 you're doing well compared to where you  
 could be it will completely change  
 everything for you and your team now I'm  
 going to ask you this question as  
 well if I let's do  
 this if I said the  
 words Boiler Room selling what's the  
 first image that comes to your mind  
 right now Boiler Room selling what's the  
 first image that comes to your mind  
 somebody stand up what's the first image  
 that comes to your mind when they say  
 Boiler Room selling what's  
 that I don't know him personally but  
 wolf on Wall Street right something like  
 this is it like this yeah hey I got a  
 great opportunity for you we talk about  
 our features and benefits and the  
 opportunity and why they need to go with  
 us and then we push and pressure and try  
 to make them go with us because we've  
 got the best this the best that right  
 that's just like when you tell your  
 spouse your partner or your kids that  
 they really really need to do something  
 then you push and pressure them what do  
 they typically do back oh they push back  
 see that's just human behavior 101 so if  
 they're pushing back why would you  
 expect your prospects not to push  
 back if pushy salese push you and you  
 push back why would you not expect them  
 to push back when you're doing the same  
 thing oh okay we're starting to think a  
 little bit now okay now first  
 mode so we are the least  
 persuasive when we tell people things so  
 according to the data pesky data we're  
 the least persuasive when we tell people  
 things when we attempt to dominate them  
 when we manipulate them when we posture  
 them when we push and pressure them we  
 the least  
 persuasive hence sales is a numbers game  
 because we are causing it to be a  
 numbers game by the way we communicate  
 now I'm going to show you a few examples  
 of the least persuasive way to sell  
 according to the  
 science presenting we've all been taught  
 that you have to have an amazing  
 presentation which you do you have to  
 have a  
 presentation we talk about oh here's our  
 we pull up our slides or there's some  
 type of webinar we show them and here's  
 a picture of our corporate offices and  
 our cool building and here's a picture  
 of our Founders they have the most  
 Integrity heard that one so many times  
 here's a picture of like our products  
 they're so awesome here's a picture of  
 our JD Power and Customer Service Awards  
 here's our AAA rating with the Better  
 Business Bureau we have the best this we  
 have the best that which by the way  
 doesn't every single salesperson or  
 distributor in this industry say that  
 they have the number one product number  
 one service represent the number one  
 company anybody ever heard of that oh oh  
 yeah now just so you know  
 psychologically when you say things like  
 that your prospects actually trust you  
 less especially if you talk down about  
 your competition do you know why do you  
 know why I almost fell over that because  
 they are used to every single person  
 that's ever tried to sell them saying  
 the same thing how many salese or  
 Distributors you talk to says yeah we're  
 the six best in the  
 market nobody right anybody ever watched  
 like The Bachelor or Bachelorette oh  
 guil oh it's okay you know what do they  
 always say when the host comes out the  
 the host comes out they're like this is  
 the most dramatic the most exciting  
 season ever and you're like that's so  
 awkward because that said that for 23  
 years straight so I don't really believe  
 them anymore see you don't believe them  
 when they say that do you yeah  
 ah okay now that doesn't mean you go and  
 say we suck or anything there's  
 obviously some some fine life so when  
 we're presenting still have to have a  
 presentation but we typically do not  
 want the presentation to be more than  
 10% of your entire sales conversation  
 and that's a major issue because on  
 average in any industry we train 158  
 different Industries at seventh level  
 yours being one of those the average  
 person in all those Industries presents  
 about half the time your industry even  
 worse just being real it's about 70% of  
 the time you are talking 70% of the time  
 about your thing okay that's number one  
 so we want to get that down to about 10%  
 which we're going to go over later when  
 we go more into the workshop telling  
 your story hate to tell you this when  
 you're selling one: one nobody cares  
 about their story whose story do they  
 care about oh their story I can't  
 imagine what about putting sales  
 pressure on them a lot of you don't  
 think you're doing that but what's  
 really going on in their mind right see  
 there is a massive difference and we're  
 going to talk about this later today  
 when we go through the scripting there's  
 a massive difference in getting your  
 prospects to feel so much internal  
 tension internal  
 tension about their problems building a  
 gap from where they are to where they  
 want to be feeling that internal tension  
 then putting external sales pressure and  
 pushing them now internal tension can  
 only happen by one of two things either  
 they're a lay down like Brian says every  
 blind scroll eventually finds a nut and  
 they're going to buy from you no matter  
 who you are you can't even talk they're  
 going to sign up there's that one person  
 out there you know what I mean the one  
 or two a year you're getting okay that's  
 that's that or your  
 questioning ability and your tone helps  
 build that internal tension we're going  
 to talk about that okay and remember  
 what is the biggest emotional driver in  
 a human being that causes them to want  
 to change pain or the fear of future  
 pain that's what causes a human being to  
 want to change there's that word again  
 change so if we can't help them relive  
 pain or see or feel the future pain  
 there's no urgency for them to want to  
 change see where we're going with this  
 all right and then another one here's  
 the big one assuming the sale especially  
 early in the  
 conversation and that's  
 exactly why not all but most of probably  
 the sales training you've gone through  
 says that sales is a numbers game right  
 and I always thought okay sales is a  
 numbers game you got to call more leads  
 you got to work more you got to work  
 harder you know just get more NOS it's  
 going to lead to the  
 yes how does that give you any  
 competitive advantage over anybody else  
 just going to work harder and somehow  
 you're going to make it basically what  
 that sales trainer just told you is what  
 I'm training you doesn't really work  
 that well so unfortunately for you  
 you're just going to have to work harder  
 and just call more leads that's not very  
 nice of them I don't want to to work  
 three times as many hours right all  
 right now it's exactly why we trigger  
 what's called fight ORF flight mode  
 we're going to talk about that later  
 today raise your hand if you ever heard  
 of fight or flight mode ah raise your  
 hand if you know how it's triggered in  
 the brain more than likely most of you  
 probably don't know that unless you have  
 a background in Psychology okay all  
 right and error number two con uh  
 consultative selling so consultative  
 selling the second mode of selling came  
 out ' 70s early ' 80s with books like  
 spin selling Neil rackam uh Sandler  
 Institute um and they taught Neil rackam  
 college professor never sold anything by  
 the way but they taught that you needed  
 to ask questions or logical based  
 questions Define the needs of the client  
 but what's a potential downfall of only  
 asking logical based questions what type  
 of answers or prospects going to give us  
 in return logical based surface level  
 answers and to human beings Buy on logic  
 or emotion emotion so more persuasive  
 than the first mode of telling your  
 story putting sales pressure on them  
 close close close close but we're still  
 having to play the numbers game because  
 we're bringing out very little emotion  
 in the actual Prospect and that's why I  
 always say you can never sell to just  
 the needs of the client oh that's  
 blasphemy  
 Jeremy you can never let me repeat that  
 you can never sell to just the needs of  
 the client do you know why because most  
 of your prospects when you first start  
 talking to them don't even know what  
 they need when you first start talking  
 to them can I give you an example of  
 this because some of you that's I darey  
 I don't know about that I I hear  
 everything else you're saying but I I  
 don't know I'm in sales I got to sell to  
 the  
 needs let's say that you wake up  
 tomorrow morning now this is just for  
 Illustrated purposes not going to happen  
 to any of you you wake up tomorrow  
 morning like oh my God I have such a bad  
 headache my head hurts so bad I've got a  
 bad migraine I need to go to urgent care  
 I need to get some medication because  
 that's what you think you need So you  
 you're like okay the co-pay my insurance  
 my budget is going to be $100 I got a  
 $100 budget you go into urgent care and  
 the doctor she starts to ask you some  
 questions about the pain and where the  
 pain is in your head and how long you've  
 had the pain and what the pain feels  
 like and what the Pain's preventing you  
 from being able to do and other pointed  
 questions and now suddenly her questions  
 start to get you to feel  
 internally you might have a much bigger  
 problem than you originally thought you  
 had she then suggests that you need to  
 go do a CAT scan and the CAT scan comes  
 back that you have a tumor not only that  
 it is a terminal tumor and you have two  
 weeks to live  
 now the solution to solve that is to do  
 surgery and remove that tumor and that's  
 a $2 million surgery you're insurance is  
 going to cover 90% you got really good  
 plan that leaves you with a budget now  
 of  
 $200,000 to solve that problem well the  
 hell with the $100 budget you thought  
 that's what you  
 needed but now you know what you need  
 because of the doctor getting you to  
 internalize what your real problems are  
 because if you would have went into that  
 doctor and said I got the pain in the  
 head she's like oh here you go here's  
 some medication you wouldn't be alive 2  
 weeks later cuz she was selling to what  
 you thought you needed instead her  
 questions allowed her to be able to sell  
 to what the real problems were never  
 sell to needs sell to what your  
 questions help you and them find what  
 their real problems are see the  
 difference in what we're talking about  
 these are massive differences that take  
 you from here to make seven figures or  
 more in your business every single year  
 all right now let's keep moving  
 on can I show you some questions I see  
 lots of  
 scripts so we we train every industry  
 including yours who have Global sales  
 trainers all over the world we see all  
 these scripts all the time that come  
 into our  
 offices now can I show you a few no okay  
 here's here's my concern in doing this  
 can I can I tell you my concern concern  
 okay  
 okay I'm concern for  
 you that if I show you some surface  
 level questions and then show you what  
 they're really doing in the prospect's  
 brain that it's Ro going to screw you up  
 tomorrow when you start talking to  
 prospects  
 again okay so we have to decide here  
 which direction we're going to go now  
 some of these are from you guys so I  
 paid attention and these actually are  
 not bad okay from I've seen a lot of  
 network marketing scripts promise you  
 these are not bad they're pretty good  
 but I can show you how to make them a  
 lot  
 better  
 okay because my concern  
 is you're going to be like really  
 screwed up cuz you thought they're  
 really working well maybe not so well so  
 we have to decide are we going to you  
 know we going to keep taking the blue  
 pill over here or we going to take the  
 red  
 pill cuz once you start to take the red  
 pill it you can't really go it's hard to  
 go  
 back or or we can just stay you know  
 comfortable with being uncomfortable  
 sales is a numbers game I hope and pray  
 it's going to work out one day down the  
 road I'll find this perfect you know  
 person and they're going to recruit  
 everybody for me and I'm going to make  
 all this money and get rich we can keep  
 taking the blue pill or we can take the  
 red pill and take  
 control sure okay I gave you a warning  
 all right  
 now not bad so some of you do reels  
 right some of you do real and I would do  
 that if I was in network marketing I was  
 a network markeing for I think from late  
 2009 to like middle of 2014 end of 2014  
 about 4 and half five years I wasn't  
 really on social media did a little bit  
 differently but if I was I would  
 definitely do reals now I would  
 definitely build a brand for sure 100%  
 so a lot of you when you get into the  
 DMS when they make comments you say this  
 question right hey were you looking for  
 more information on the water or were  
 you just being supportive being  
 supportive I kind of like that but  
 here's my suggestion when you ask them  
 were you looking for more  
 information what type of way of thinking  
 has I automatically put the  
 logical based information thinking just  
 by saying that are you looking for more  
 information they say yes you seen the  
 information you most of the time never  
 hear back from am I right cuz you put  
 them in information based thinking okay  
 so how many of you when you do that now  
 you get some people they're like oh yeah  
 I'm really interested those are the more  
 the  
 laydowns see you can already sell to lay  
 down I don't need to be here for that I  
 don't need to train you don't need to go  
 through our our client training programs  
 anything if you're okay with just  
 selling to the laydowns I'm more  
 interested in helping you sell to the  
 other  
 97% of your prospects that you're  
 struggling with right now okay because  
 that's what I learned how to do and I  
 learned how to teach people how to do  
 that so this is why your prospects say  
 to you even after you give them the  
 information do you notice what  
 objections you get I need to do more  
 research I need to keep looking at this  
 um I need to think it over I need to  
 talk something speci about it or can you  
 send me more information raise your hand  
 if you still get those objections even  
 after you do this ah okay all right now  
 we're now we're starting to go somewhere  
 so here is how I would rather re  
 language this let me try to get my tone  
 going  
 here can I ask a favor um is there any  
 like can I have like two chairs in the  
 very back right up here on the stage so  
 when I do some of this I actually get  
 into into like roleplay mode rather than  
 like training mode it's a little bit  
 different maybe two chairs that nobody's  
 setting in the bra  
 back so I might change it to a little  
 bit of this now let me help you with  
 well actually you're in the DMS but if  
 you were on the phone I would show you  
 the tone hey I saw you uh comment on  
 that post I did about the differences in  
 water and how blank water can help  
 eliminate blank so I'm going to take  
 that as a compliment cuz my kids say I'm  
 pretty boring and put a smiley face on  
 it now this does a few  
 things I saw you comment on that post I  
 did about the differences in water and  
 how blank water can eliminate blank  
 whatever you guys put in so I'm going to  
 take that as a compliment because my  
 kids say I'm pretty boring put a smiling  
 face now what does that do smile okay  
 first I se a doubt in their mind that  
 maybe little bit of Doubt just beginning  
 maybe the water they're drinking might  
 not be so good without me saying that  
 I'm starting to seed it just a little  
 just a little bit we'll get into how you  
 see it better than this but this is just  
 a little bit you got to see it like just  
 you got to give you ever heard that  
 saying in the scriptures where you got  
 to give them the milk before you give  
 the meat this is what we do in selling  
 as well okay but do you want to hop in  
 now what that does is it pequs curiosity  
 so instead of information dumping I'm  
 triggering  
 curiosity I'm more neutral okay now  
 second when I say I'm going to take that  
 as a compliment cuz my kids say I'm  
 pretty boring and I put a smiley face  
 that does what disarms it helps disarm  
 them because I'm almost like making fun  
 of myself not in a horrible way but I'm  
 just kind of making F you know what  
 they're going to do oh watch nine out of  
 10 say like oh I'm sure you're not  
 boring  
 right so even though now I had to put  
 the smiley face behind it cuz I don't  
 put the smiley face in the DMS they're  
 like like oh you are pretty boring it  
 looks weird or if I'm on the phone I'm  
 like oh you know just hanging out being  
 the boring guy but if I'm like just  
 hanging out being  
 boring oh yeah that's he must be really  
 boring okay so see how my tone affects  
 that so if we can't use our tone in the  
 DMS then you just put you have to use  
 the emojis it's kind of like your tone  
 there the Emojis like signify the  
 emotion that you're using so on that I  
 put a smiley face behind it just do it  
 next time and watch immediately the  
 first thing they say oh I'm sure you're  
 not  
 boring now that helps them let their  
 guard down now that you can't just be  
 like oh hey let me tell you about it  
 Jeremy didn't work I well then I look at  
 you're like well you just started  
 talking about your thing right after of  
 course okay so that's just one way okay  
 and we we'll keep working on this all  
 right this is just something I threw  
 together real quick what do you know  
 about living  
 water it's okay it's okay okay however  
 um I'm going to go out on the limb does  
 the average Prospect you're talking to  
 really know what that even  
 means that could be a problem for you  
 okay um and it's just a very surface  
 level question so instead like I said we  
 want to start building a gap from where  
 they are to where they want to be so  
 instead I'm going to do something like  
 this if I'm focused on the water most of  
 the time I wouldn't be when we go  
 through the workshop I'm going to show  
 you how to really focus on the two major  
 problems making more money having more  
 time and then how them purchasing the  
 product helps them start the business a  
 little bit of a different angle I'm  
 going to show you exactly what I did  
 anybody have an organization that has  
 over 300,000 people in it here  
 oh does anybody want to learn how to do  
 that does anybody want to know how I did  
 that within like two  
 years does anybody want to really  
 understand how I did that as a firste  
 Network marketer with nobody not coming  
 from another network marketing company  
 with zero  
 people okay sure about that okay we're  
 going to focus on that when we do the  
 workshop all right so this stop here so  
 when we ask what do you know about  
 living water I'd rather relang it to  
 this oh give me that Sher  
 thanks so I can actually see it up  
 here hey um I don't I don't have um  
 much time now this is if you're in the  
 chats okay I'll show you on the phone or  
 Zoom a little bit different hey I don't  
 have much time to chat but do you do you  
 like drink water from like the tap like  
 the the unfiltered City water or some  
 type of like basic filter you just buy  
 like the plastic bottle water from the  
 store now what in my tone what did my  
 tone communicate to  
 you curiosity and kind of like concern  
 that seeds what in the prospect's brain  
 that maybe there's an issue with what I  
 just asked because what if I said it  
 like this see the difference in the  
 tonality what if I said it like this hey  
 I don't have much time to chat but do  
 you like drink water from the tap like  
 the unfiltered City water or some type  
 of basic filtered uh plastic bottled  
 water from the store or what do you do  
 oh yeah I just I just go to the store oh  
 but if I do like hey um I don't I don't  
 have much time to chat but do you like  
 um drink water from the tab like the you  
 know like the the unfiltered City water  
 or like some type of like basic filter  
 or just buy like the plastic bottle  
 water  
 now what did that seed in your mind oh  
 maybe those aren't maybe those aren't  
 that good but I didn't say they weren't  
 that good cuz if I said they sucked you  
 might do what get the get  
 defensive see how I can see doubt by  
 just using my tone and my facial  
 expression what is your facial  
 expression your facial expression is the  
 remote control to how your tone sounds  
 the first thing they teach you when you  
 go to acting school is how to use your  
 facial expressions to communicate and  
 use your  
 tonality because can I have a cons can I  
 have a skeptical challenging Tone If my  
 facial expression stays like this that'd  
 be really damn hard to do I couldn't do  
 that what if you don't it's like it's  
 hard to do it what happens if you don't  
 do anything about this facial expression  
 communicates my tone see what I'm doing  
 there so if I'm in the DMs I have to use  
 some type of like Emoji now don't go  
 like crazy Emoji like o gross cuz  
 sometimes that'll be a little defensive  
 what I would do is I'd actually send him  
 a voice  
 note yeah like if I was redoing cuz back  
 in my day 20 2010  
 2014 maybe they had that I just I had a  
 basic Facebook account right I was doing  
 like you know a a paper cook ads on  
 Google or just buying leads or just you  
 know talking with people I knew right  
 that's how I I started my business and  
 built it so big but if I could redo it  
 and I got them into reals I'd send voice  
 notes like this with my tone and it  
 automatically seeds doubt it seeds doubt  
 without me telling them if I tell them  
 it goes in one ear out the other I'm  
 biased I'm trying to Sal sell them right  
 but by me seing that it causes them to  
 have some doubt now we can't just stop  
 there and be like oh let me tell you  
 about my thing we have to we're setting  
 that up you see what we're doing there  
 okay let me show you a few others here  
 and like I said when after I finish the  
 the keynote we're going to really get  
 into like actual really what to say from  
 A to Z okay how about this one are you  
 open to watching a super quick video  
 that explains why this water is so  
 powerful  
 now you haven't even helped them build a  
 gap from where they are to where they  
 want to be they don't even know they  
 have a problem so how can you ask them  
 if they're open to looking at something  
 that they don't even know they have a  
 problem  
 about you're asking them if they're open  
 to watching a super quick video nobody  
 believes super quick video even if it is  
 that's like when a teller marketer when  
 a salesperson calls you like hey do you  
 have two can I take two minutes of your  
 time to tell you and you're like you  
 don't believe them do you because you  
 know the sales person is going to take  
 longer than 2 minutes so because you  
 don't believe them you automatically  
 they lower their you lower their status  
 in their mind how you view them and you  
 try to get rid of them because you've  
 just lost trust automatically So when  
 you say things like are you watching now  
 you don't have to say the video is going  
 to be 67 minutes you don't have to say  
 that I wouldn't say that either I just  
 don't need to say how long the video is  
 going to be I could say are you opposed  
 to looking at blah blah blah blah blah  
 now you're not going to do that yet cuz  
 they don't even have a problem so we  
 can't ask them to be open about a  
 problem they don't even know they have  
 yet right and then when we say the  
 because the water is so  
 powerful what the hell does that mean to  
 the prospect the water's powerful like  
 Mighty Thor like if you drink the water  
 you're going to have like superhuman  
 like crazy like spiderweb like what does  
 that actually mean I know it sounds cool  
 to you but how does it sound to your  
 prospect who doesn't even know what's  
 going on right see it's  
 okay but I don't want to train you how  
 to be okay I want to train you how to  
 have complete control of every  
 conversation you're in remember because  
 the prospect have problems Your solution  
 solves us so you're going to get some  
 people like  
 this down here but I'd rather help open  
 up your Market to this rather than this  
 see I don't like like those old say when  
 I got into network marketing they said  
 that to me I'm  
 like yeah that's that's why that's why  
 that's why a lot of you here in this I'm  
 not talking about you but the company  
 I'm with I'm like yeah that's why you  
 guys like struggle you don't make that  
 much money because that's what you think  
 selling is see if I think that they want  
 to make more money and have more time  
 which everybody does and I focus on what  
 I'm saying and asking then I have a  
 whole world I have everybody's really my  
 Prospect at that point okay all right  
 let's keep moving  
 on now the third mode here's where it  
 gets  
 interesting can I  
 have more hot water in here somebody in  
 the in the I don't know if there's  
 somebody in the hotel that can be like  
 put like hot water up to here with a  
 little bit of like cold where it's not  
 like killing me  
 but I'm almost out of water that would  
 be very  
 nice thank you okay now third mode of  
 selling the most persuasive according to  
 the data the science we the most most  
 persuasive when we get others to  
 persuade themselves when we ask what are  
 called neuro emotional persuasion  
 questions if you've read the book or  
 maybe you're one of our clients in our  
 virtual training programs or maybe even  
 you followed me on reals sometimes we'll  
 talk about neuro emotional persuasion  
 questions now the question I always get  
 asked Jeremy that sounds really good how  
 can I get someone to persuade  
 themselves that's the1 trillion doll  
 question cuz imagine if you knew how if  
 you had the skill because can you just  
 walk up to your friend or you know start  
 talking with somebody on the phone from  
 a real and be like hey hey yeah this  
 thing is awesome but just go Ahad and  
 persuade yourself and by the way I'm  
 going to send you the link to enroll and  
 the machine's like 5,000 and you're  
 Gucci I'll see you on the onboarding  
 call we so we can't do that right we  
 have to learn specific skilled questions  
 we have to learn how and how to ask  
 those that are going to get them to  
 emotionally open up okay we have to put  
 P that structure where they get us to  
 pull in now I want to make sure that you  
 understand when I'm talking about any PQ  
 questions I'm not talking about  
 questions that are designed to get your  
 prospects to say what you want them to  
 say some of you have been trained to do  
 that right if you get them to say yes 13  
 times they have a 71% chance more likely  
 to buy your your thing anybody ever  
 heard something like that if you get  
 them to say yes like 17 times in the  
 presentation um does anybody have like  
 the the the data that supports  
 that oh you just believe that because  
 you read it in a book didn't you there's  
 no data that actually says that just so  
 you're aware in fact a lot of times I'm  
 going to show you do the exact opposite  
 and get them to say no that will  
 actually lead to the  
 yes ah Jeremy oh you ready for that I  
 told you if we went down this path it's  
 going to be very hard hard to go back  
 down the other path so really going to  
 screw with your mind just okay so I'm  
 not talking about surface level  
 questions either the questions I'm  
 referring to like I said are intended to  
 bring out the prospect's  
 emotions to trigger what's called  
 emotional  
 drivers that get them into what's called  
 their emotional state anybody heard of  
 how do you get a how do you get a human  
 being into an emotional state Tony  
 Robbins talks about that right how do  
 you get them from here into their  
 emotional  
 state now this is a breakdown of npq  
 these are the five stages remember that  
 stands for neuro emotional persuasion  
 question now like I said we train a lot  
 of people in your industry that are in  
 our uh our client train virtual training  
 programs I've met a few of you they're  
 actually in our neq 3.0 and advanced  
 Inner Circle which is industry specific  
 and I can't tell you we have I don't  
 even know 18 some thousand testimonials  
 from the last 3 years and I can I could  
 I mean I've seen  
 tons from your industry people came in  
 they're making $1,000 a month two grand  
 a month a year later they're making 30  
 50 two years later they're making over  
 seven figures a  
 year now I'm going on limb did some of  
 you know that I was in your industry I  
 think some of you knew I was in your  
 industry  
 okay I got up to a little bit a little  
 bit under 2.4 million a year in your  
 industry and I did that Within 2  
 years now how is that possible to do  
 that so quickly as a brand new person  
 who's never been in MLM who had zero  
 people sometimes it's easy if they come  
 over from another company they're  
 bringing 100,000 people or 50,000 people  
 with them depending on your comp plan  
 right let me show you  
 something what's what's that in the  
 yellow there that's your oh that's me  
 yes I googled this I for forgot about  
 this I'm like I think there was some  
 article so this was the end of my  
 network marketing career like my close  
 to my fifth year it was uh that's the  
 website there you can go Google whatever  
 it's the top 150 worldwide earners in  
 MLM you see April 20 2014 I'm that old  
 you have to submit like your your W2s  
 your 1099s depending on your page so you  
 have to like prove that you actually  
 made this money that's me number 45 in  
 the world and that I think that was my  
 third or fourth year something like that  
 now had I continued probably another 10  
 years probably would have made a lot  
 more than that but that's besides the  
 story now do you see the person right  
 here number  
 44 where it says Nathan rcks he's a he's  
 a big time Network Mark he passed away  
 actually a couple years ago I don't know  
 if you know that he had a it was in a  
 plane wreck he was flying his own plane  
 very sad but the story behind that how I  
 got into network marketing is Nathan  
 Ricks he was a distributor for a company  
 called new skin out of Utah for you guys  
 big company and somebody in his dad  
 downline when I had my sales job there  
 in Utah tried to recruit me he brought  
 like the guy in his downline brought me  
 to like a meeting like this and Nathan  
 was up there presenting and he like want  
 the guy wanted to have me meet Nathan  
 and I remember when I met Nathan after  
 for like uh like just like a lunch or  
 snacks or whatever they totally blew me  
 off and he later told the guy like I  
 don't think that guy would be very good  
 for network  
 marketing and that when I heard that cuz  
 I wasn't going to do it that caused me  
 to be like that mother ever I'm going to  
 freaking show  
 him so now Nathan I'm sure it's not a  
 big deal right it is what it is but that  
 drove me that put like a chip on my  
 shoulder had he recruited me in his  
 downline he'd been further up that list  
 right really quick okay there you go  
 never judge a book by its cover  
 sometimes right there you go all right  
 now would it help you if I started  
 showing you some maybe neq specific  
 questions for your industry okay okay  
 I'm only going to show you a few during  
 this next 30 40 minutes and then after  
 the break we're going to come back in  
 I'm going to show you the entire sales  
 structure and we're going to role play  
 and you're going to come up here up the  
 man stage and we're going to learn we're  
 going to start to learn how to do this  
 now are you going to be able to learn  
 and master everything today in one day  
 okay as my good friend bradle always  
 says is training something you did or is  
 training something you do do well  
 training something do if you want to  
 make a lot of money does Steph Curry  
 train something he did or something he  
 does every day Michael Jordan something  
 he did some Serena Williams something  
 she did something she does okay Julia  
 Roberts something she did something that  
 she do does see that's why they make all  
 the  
 money see a parallel with any any  
 successful person you admire in  
 life they don't view training as  
 something they did they view it as  
 something they do daily and that's why  
 they're ahead of you so far now how do  
 you change that well you just do the  
 same thing train something you do okay  
 all right now let's move  
 on before I do that I want to show you  
 how what's going on in your prospect's  
 brain when you when you talk to  
 them so within the first 7 to 12 seconds  
 of any sales  
 conversation that you're ever going to  
 be in so that is is it could be on the  
 phone it could be in person could be on  
 Zoom whatever you use your prospects  
 they cannot even help it subconsciously  
 it's the way our brain is wired by God  
 are picking up on your verbal and  
 non-verbal cues based off what you are  
 saying and asking and how your Tome is  
 coming  
 across that quickly so when you have a  
 telemarketer call you and they start  
 talking really fast and  
 excited what's going on in your  
 brain salesperson trying to S something  
 not interested and you hang up and you  
 ever wonder like oh I don't even know  
 what they were  
 saying you didn't even hear the words  
 they said isn't that  
 remarkable wow do you know why I'll give  
 you a little lesson I'm going to take a  
 little bit more time there's three parts  
 of your brain I'm going to give you the  
 easy version okay there's I'm not going  
 to there's different different  
 behavioral scientists will call it  
 different names but there's like the  
 first part is your survival part of your  
 brain it's called like your reptilian  
 part of the brain that is where you  
 start to pick up on sounds tone okay so  
 whenever God put the first people here  
 on the earth whenever that was okay we  
 had that survival part of our brain so  
 when the tiger came around us we're like  
 oh I you know I need to protect myself  
 now in our society we're still trying to  
 protect ourselves from the Tigers you  
 know the bad the bad guys trying to  
 shoot us or whatever it is  
 but we're also trying to protect  
 ourselves from what being sold right  
 because you're constantly being sold to  
 every day now some of you like no I  
 don't talk to sales people every day  
 yeah you do what's the first thing you  
 do when you wake up in the morning  
 besides go to the bathroom you grab your  
 phone and you start looking at what  
 social media and you start seeing ads  
 trying to sell you  
 something then you walk into your  
 kitchen start drinking your coffee turn  
 on the TV you see commercials trying to  
 sell you something you get into the car  
 to go to work or to wherever you're  
 going you turn on the radio and you hear  
 ads trying to sell you something you  
 drive down the road and there's like  
 these big signs on the side of the  
 Billboards and they're trying to sell  
 you something you go to your job if  
 you're still working full-time at a job  
 and during lunch you get on the phone  
 and you start seeing your aunt and she's  
 pitching her latest greatest whatever  
 thing the 17th thing she's gotten into  
 in the last 3 years right that's the  
 best thing right  
 see you're constantly being sold to all  
 of the time and because of that human  
 beings you me all of us have built up  
 walls of Defense so whenever we feel or  
 hear sounds or words that we identify  
 coming from someone trying to sell us we  
 immediately emotionally shut down and we  
 either try to get rid of them fight mode  
 or flight mode we're like oh yeah that  
 sounds really good and we listen to the  
 whole conversation and then at the end  
 your prospect says this sound's really  
 good I just need to talk with my wife I  
 need to talk with my CPA I need to talk  
 with my mom I need to talk with my  
 grandpa I need to talk with my best  
 friend who lives in a van down by the  
 river and so and so and so and then you  
 never hear from them  
 again are you with  
 me  
 okay  
 now so when you come across aggressive  
 in your conversation now when I say  
 aggressive I don't mean like you're mean  
 I mean like you're too excited now that  
 doesn't mean be boring I don't mean like  
 go from here to here there's like a  
 middle ground okay so I don't mean to be  
 boring sometimes people like Jeremy I'm  
 trying out I we review calls and like  
 you sound really boring what is going  
 now I don't mean be boring like a oh I  
 hope you try but you the more excited  
 you sound what is the average Prospect  
 going to associate excitement from  
 salesperson trying to sell me something  
 because that's how salese are taught to  
 ask right so when you come across  
 needy when you come across when you have  
 anxiety you know what I'm talking you  
 ever felt needy on a call with the  
 prospect oh yeah now if you feel that  
 what do you feel the prospect is feeling  
 from you they're subconsciously they're  
 listening to your tone and when it  
 sounds needy or anxiety or nervous it  
 triggers them to feel that you are  
 hiding something or something is bad or  
 not true that you're saying see what I  
 mean okay when we come across  
 attached now what do I mean by attached  
 oh I'm so excited I know you're going to  
 love it can you call me back after you  
 watch it today I think it's going to be  
 so great is that attached sounds  
 attached sounds like you need them to  
 join and when somebody it's like when  
 you're dating originally and somebody  
 starts texting you and they sound really  
 needy in the text and when you don't  
 respond and they respond and they send  
 you four five six text because you never  
 respond how do you view them lower  
 status even if you might have liked them  
 and thought they were good looking you  
 start to view them at a lowered status  
 CU they feel needy to you wow see what  
 we're going okay there you hopefully I'm  
 helping your dating lives too  
 okay  
 now so that triggers him like I said to  
 go into fight or flight mode these are  
 triggered  
 reactions because did your prospect do  
 you think they woke  
 up that morning that they were going to  
 talk to you that you had a scheduled  
 appointment with them let's say did they  
 wake up and they're like you know what  
 when she asked me that third question  
 because she sounds really needy and she  
 sounds really enthusiastic I think I'm  
 going to go into fight ORF flight mode  
 and say hey enough with the questions  
 can you just tell me how much it's going  
 to cost and I'll tell you if I'm  
 interested did she plan that out or is  
 that a triggered reaction based on how  
 you're communicating to them yes ah so  
 if it's coming from us that means what  
 that we can change that and we have the  
 power to change that doesn't come from  
 them at all see how we're where we're  
 going now once you learn what we're  
 going to train you this and this is just  
 the start today once you learn how to  
 become how you come across more neutral  
 more unbiased like I'm not not quite  
 sure we could even help yet I'd have to  
 know more about XYZ you're more neutral  
 you're more unbiased you're more  
 Collective you're more calm you're  
 assertive assertive does not mean overly  
 enthusiastic assertive is more like an  
 expert more like an expert talks more  
 like an authority a trusted Authority  
 and especially when you come across  
 detached how many really successful  
 experts are  
 attached they don't need to be attached  
 they're detached they know that you have  
 the problems and they have the solution  
 to solve those but it has it doesn't  
 affect them if you don't do anything  
 about it it only affects who oh you good  
 see the difference there once we learn  
 the right questions asked once we learn  
 Tone It triggers their brain to become  
 curious enough where they want to engage  
 and actually open up to you because they  
 feel like you might have something  
 important for them they don't even know  
 what it is yet and I'll give you an  
 example of  
 this let's say that you're walking into  
 the grocery store  
 okay I'm just going to take a little bit  
 more time if this is okay I'm going to  
 go over over the keynote time I know I  
 have 20 minutes I'm going to go like  
 35 so well we're going to come back it's  
 all the same if I if I only had 30  
 minutes I'd hurry up but I'm going to  
 give you a few examples so let's say  
 you're walking into a grocery store and  
 all of a sudden you hear like a lady  
 yelling like screaming your first  
 reaction remember I'm going back to the  
 brain is your survival part of your  
 brain is like this you react to the  
 sound to the tone you react am I safe  
 what's going on is there you know a  
 shooting like what's happening so you  
 react you didn't even hear her words yet  
 okay that's in your survival part of  
 your brain now instantly in about a  
 second or so I'm going to keep this term  
 very simple for you it goes into what we  
 would call their midbrain the midbrain  
 starts to interpret the words from that  
 lady and then immediately goes to your  
 problem solving part of your brain which  
 is your neocortex and your problem  
 solving brain says like oh it's just a  
 lady yelling at her son to to be careful  
 crossing the street I'm  
 okay but you instantly reacted from the  
 tone first first going through your  
 survival Brain before you interpreted  
 her words to mean that you're okay does  
 that make sense okay okay I just want to  
 make sure he understands because once  
 you understand this when you're on  
 conversations you hold a complete  
 Advantage because you know what's going  
 on in their mind okay closest thing you  
 can become to coming a mind reader all  
 right now I'm going to ask you this how  
 do you get your prospect to view you at  
 a higher  
 status because like I said earlier how  
 are  
 salespeople and dare I say distributors  
 in network marketing viewed in society  
 as a whole if I'm really honest how are  
 they  
 viewed lower status even if you are a  
 millionaire or multi-million in this  
 industry the average person still views  
 you at a what a lowered status based on  
 what because of the way typically people  
 in this industry and salespeople in  
 general communicate with other people  
 people that is caused by us not them  
 okay  
 now I'm going to ask you  
 again if I show you some questions you  
 are asking right now which you feel are  
 building  
 Rapport but are really  
 not are you going to be upset at me on  
 Monday cuz when you get on calls you're  
 going to be like oh I shouldn't say that  
 okay so are we are we okay to move  
 forward or cuz I can we can stop  
 everything now okay all  
 right  
 okay all right now Behavioral Science  
 this is called social  
 dynamics how does society view you how  
 does a person view you at a much higher  
 status than themselves in the  
 conversation you're talking about so  
 even if you're talking to someone that  
 makes 25 billion times more money than  
 you and you're talking about your  
 opportunity how can you even though they  
 make way more money than you how can you  
 get them to view you at a much higher  
 status with what you're talking about  
 that's called situational status it's  
 called rank framing or status framing  
 back in medieval times or thousands of  
 years ago how did they rank a human  
 being usually it was the tattoos and  
 symb on your arms that's how they ranked  
 you right or if you're a queen or queen  
 like that's how you're ranked how does  
 society rank us now usually by how much  
 money you make the things you drive the  
 cars you just that's how they rank  
 that's how they view you okay so if you  
 don't have those things yet notice I  
 said yet how do you get situational  
 status where they view you as an expert  
 far more as an expert in what you're  
 talking about that's what I'm going to  
 show you okay  
 now  
 I don't know if I should show you this a  
 little bit  
 worried so when you get on does some of  
 you like get on Zoom with prospects or  
 call them on the phone after because I  
 know a lot of you like get them in the  
 DMS right or or you talk with somebody  
 that you might know you get them on Zoom  
 you get them on the phone and typically  
 you ask this type of predictable  
 question hey how you doing today hey  
 how's your day going George yeah how's  
 the weather over there in Dallas oh the  
 weather's so so cool here it's so  
 awesome um yeah did you watch the game  
 last night oh it's such a cool game yeah  
 so awesome um see when you ask these  
 type of predictable  
 questions that every salesperson that's  
 ever tried to sell them anything from a  
 vacuum cleaner to a car to life  
 insurance policy to a home to maybe  
 cyber security for their  
 office and they're all asking the same  
 type of question what would the average  
 Prospect immediately associate you with  
 like everybody  
 else and a society and if they view  
 salespeople at a lowered  
 status how do they view you if you're  
 asking the same questions that all other  
 salespeople ask them more than likely at  
 a much lower status unless they're lay  
 down lay downs they'll open up to you  
 okay because when most prospects this is  
 how they interpret that type of question  
 how's your day going how you doing those  
 type of particular question here's how  
 they view it I'm just trying to get you  
 to like me so I can sell you my product  
 my service  
 thing cuz when salese ask you that  
 question what usually goes on in your  
 mind could I be right they're just  
 trying to get me to like them so they  
 can sell me something and immediately  
 what the what goes up the guard goes  
 up and do you ever notice that when you  
 do that the guard goes up and you ask  
 good questions but they give you vague  
 generalized surface level  
 answers well now you know why because  
 you're triggering that from the very  
 first words out of your mouth okay now  
 don't worry I'm here to show you how to  
 change that not just going to show you  
 what to do that's bad I'm going to show  
 you what to do instead okay all right  
 now this is an example of what we call  
 npq connection questions now connection  
 questions uh basically they they get the  
 prospect they take the focus off you  
 immediately and they automatically put  
 it on the Prospect and what they also do  
 is we want to get the prospect into what  
 we call results based thinking over  
 price or cost based thinking do some of  
 you ever get like oh this seems really  
 expensive or you guys is that's just way  
 too much money for me or I don't have  
 the money do you know why it's because  
 you're getting them you're keeping them  
 in price or cost based thinking where  
 I'm going to show you how to get them  
 into results based thinking where they  
 don't even look at the price they look  
 at the end  
 result and I'm gonna show you that okay  
 all right now let me give you an inbound  
 example here and like I said I'm going  
 to go over a little bit over time cuz we  
 got all day if you guys are okay with  
 that all  
 right let's what is what is this the  
 shaking thing over there who is that  
 over there oh what is  
 that I'm not used to that at Keynotes  
 I'm like man this this grub is really  
 Lively they're shaking things  
 over  
 okay so let's say let's let's say that  
 you have an inbound lead somebody's  
 commented on one of your reals okay and  
 you DM them you built up somewhat of a  
 gap and they agreed to book on your  
 calendar do some of you do this like use  
 reals get them on your calendar book a  
 phone call book a zoom call anybody do  
 that in here some of you okay now  
 obviously if it's a friend we would have  
 to you know if we already know them we  
 would we would definitely tweak this but  
 let's say it's a stranger that's been  
 following you on Instagram I'm just  
 making something up and they get on the  
 phone with you um like I said if it's a  
 if we're talking to a friend at a  
 networking event or whatever we would  
 obviously tweak this but let's say I'm  
 on Zoom I'm seeing you hey can you hear  
 me yes I can hear you can you see me  
 yeah I can see you stuff like that and  
 then immediately I'm going to go right  
 into results based thinking like this  
 okay so it looks like we were I know we  
 were chatting on uh Instagram the other  
 day about you looking at maybe you know  
 starting your own business so you could  
 make more money right okay it looks like  
 we were chatting the other day I think  
 it was a couple days ago about you  
 looking at maybe starting your own  
 business so you can make more money  
 right right what did I instantly do  
 right there that's such a basic question  
 but what does it do what is the end  
 result of what you sell starting a  
 business so you can what make more money  
 do you see how I'm automatically getting  
 that person into what results based  
 Thinking by saying starting your own  
 business so you can make more money  
 right they're going to be like right  
 automatically results based thinking  
 that's just the very big see how Bas see  
 how easy that is okay take a picture of  
 that like I said we've got I have all  
 the sales structure written out for you  
 already I shouldn't have told you that  
 but we're going to train on that and  
 maybe maybe Colt and those guys will  
 give it to you one day okay now let me  
 show you a few things that I did here  
 why would I use the word possibly start  
 your own business not yes I want to be  
 more neutral okay because if I assumed  
 look how it sound okay so it looks like  
 we were chatting on IG the other day  
 about you starting your own business so  
 you can make more money some a types  
 would be like well I'm just looking at  
 it I'm not saying that I'm I'm going to  
 do it yet and you immediately just did  
 what triggered C's resistance all I had  
 to do was put the term possibly the word  
 possibly before it nobody's ever going  
 to say no I'm not possibly looking at  
 making more money to start their own  
 business like they can't say say that  
 see I neutralize that see how that one  
 neutral word possibly now you don't want  
 to keep saying possibly 17 times during  
 the conversation because then it's going  
 to sound weird okay but that term  
 neutralizes it where you'll never  
 trigger sales resistance just by putting  
 a neutral term there see how I want to  
 use words that what work with human  
 behavior rather than work against it see  
 how one word can completely change the  
 dynamic of that opening conversation  
 because because if you trigger sales  
 incidence right there status goes what  
 down lower and now the rest of the  
 conversation you have to trying to get  
 back up to at least the same status as  
 them see I want to make sure that when I  
 come into a conversation even in that  
 first 30 seconds they view me at least  
 at the same status as they are and  
 during that  
 conversation I start to raise my status  
 in their mind and by the end they view  
 me as the authority the expert who's  
 going to get them where they want to be  
 see see what I just did there okay let's  
 keep going on here all right now this is  
 an example I'm just giving you a few  
 random examples and then we're going to  
 give you everything when we actually do  
 the  
 training this is called an npq status  
 frame okay so I want has anybody ever  
 had training where they talk to you  
 about getting on a call and they want  
 you to do like what's called like an  
 upfront contract where has anybody ever  
 heard the upfront contract so and it's  
 not bad but sometimes it can trigger  
 sales resistance so is anybody got on a  
 call like okay towards the end of the  
 call you know I'm going to here's how  
 the call is going to go so you tell them  
 here's how the call is going to go today  
 I'm going to ask you some questions and  
 depending on your answers at the end of  
 the conversation you you know you can  
 decide if we're a good fit for you and  
 we can decide if you're a good fit for  
 us sound  
 fair you ever heard of that yes  
 oh do we really believe that the average  
 Prospect thinks at the end of the  
 conversation if they're like here's my  
 credit card I am ready to sign up and  
 buy and change your life nope nope I  
 don't think you're a good fit for us I  
 can't take your money I'm so sorry  
 you're not a good fit for us do you  
 really believe your prospects would  
 believe that so when you say things like  
 that that they don't believe what does  
 that do lower status you lose trust  
 sales pretty much over or if a lot of  
 people like yeah that sounds fair and  
 then what are they doing in the  
 background  
 stay surface level now because they  
 think they're going to get closed at the  
 end right so when you ask questions they  
 never what emotionally open up they stay  
 surface level they stay logical and then  
 what objections do you get at the  
 end doesn't sound very fun what are you  
 guys killing yourself that's no bueno  
 all right so we want to do something  
 different okay let's see if I can get  
 the right tone here got to warm up  
 okay yeah now there's after that first  
 connection question I showed you there  
 is one between that so you wouldn't hop  
 right into this and I will show you on  
 the sales structure that we wrote for  
 you uh that we do with other companies  
 the difference here but this is kind of  
 like the third connection question  
 you're going to use yeah and I would say  
 you know really this call is it's pretty  
 basic it's really more for us to find  
 out you know kind of what you do for a  
 living now and I would say maybe what  
 they're what they're paying you compared  
 to maybe what you're really wanting to  
 make to see kind of what that Gap looks  
 like and then you know towards the end  
 of the call if you feel like hey you  
 know this might be what you're looking  
 for we can talk about uh possible next  
 steps would that help you wow now let's  
 analyze that first  
 paragraph why would I say ah this call  
 it's pretty basic why would I downplay  
 it what does that  
 do yeah cuz I I want them to do  
 what because a lot of you are like oh  
 this I'm so excited for you to be on  
 this call but I'm downplaying because if  
 I downplay it that's it that's in in in  
 brain science that's a term called  
 mismatching has anybody heard of that  
 when you mismatch and you downplay  
 things typically people up playay them  
 but when you up playay things people  
 downplay especially if they view you as  
 a salesperson right because you're like  
 oh you're going to save so much money  
 well it's not going to be that much I  
 mean you're not going to save that much  
 money it's only going to be like 3%  
 that's a lot of money for  
 us  
 see I downplay they up playay I up  
 playay they downplay you want to be  
 careful with that okay so I'm  
 downplaying yeah this first call it's  
 it's pretty basic it's really more for  
 us to find out you know kind of what you  
 do for a living now you know kind of  
 what they're paying you those type of  
 things and how that is working out  
 compared to maybe where you're wanting  
 to be what did I just do there look at  
 what I said there what they're doing now  
 with you what what they're paying you if  
 I'm focused on the business right  
 remember making more money having more  
 time problems you solve compared to  
 maybe where you're wanting to be what  
 did I just do  
 visually I just started visually put a  
 gap in their mind see how I seated a gap  
 oh you didn't see that did you because  
 what if I did this and the first part of  
 this call it's pretty basic it's really  
 more for us to find out kind of what you  
 do for a living and and what they're  
 paying you and kind of what you're  
 wanting to make to you know to see what  
 the Gap looks like let didn't do  
 anything so I need to like this don't be  
 like this see people in the side like do  
 this yeah the first part of this call  
 it's pretty basic I want them to lower  
 their guard I want them to relax because  
 if they relax they are more willing to  
 emotionally open  
 up okay there's no go the S the guard is  
 gone like I want to keep it do you guys  
 like competing against the Wall of  
 Resistance like I don't like that I'd  
 rather not have any Wall of Resistance  
 okay much easier to sell way less  
 objections okay way faster way to build  
 build your business okay uh compared to  
 maybe where you're wanting to be to see  
 what that Gap looks like and then  
 towards the end of the call if you feel  
 like hey you know this might be what  
 you're looking for we can talk about  
 possible next steps would that help you  
 no one will ever say no it would not  
 help me to talk about possible next  
 steps they can't do that you see what I  
 just did there why did I use the words  
 might be what you're looking for we can  
 talk about possible next steps see what  
 now at the end of that conversation I  
 can be more assumptive but in the  
 beginning when I have really zero trust  
 and credibility the more assumptive I am  
 the more the guard goes up so I want to  
 use might be impossible I wouldn't use  
 that at the very end and I will show you  
 that later today okay I'm going way too  
 slow I got to keep looking up okay  
 solution awareness questions here's an  
 example gets them to see what their  
 future looks like once the new found  
 problems are solved you guys might want  
 to put more time back on the clock all  
 right now here's an example of this  
 okay so tell me so this is probably  
 three4 of the convers so tell me about  
 the money I mean you had mentioned that  
 you wanted to make more money because I  
 mean as you know like working for  
 someone else you know sometimes you're  
 you're fairly limited on on what they're  
 going to want to pay you so without that  
 limit there like what what would you  
 really want to make like in your own  
 business like what would be I don't know  
 like what would be like your let's say  
 like your ideal income maybe even annual  
 like what what do you really want to  
 make now  
 why did I really slow that question down  
 because I knew exactly what I was going  
 to say there yeah but did I act like I  
 knew what I was going to say there you  
 viewed me as  
 thinking deeper about what I was going  
 to ask you and psychologically what does  
 that do to the prospect picture causes  
 them to think deeper about my question  
 cuz now I gave them time CU I past it  
 out verbal past it out it gives them  
 more time to think deeper about it CU if  
 I did it like this so tell me about the  
 money You' mentioned you wanted to make  
 more money because as you know working  
 for someone else sometimes you're fairly  
 limited on what they're going to want to  
 pay you so without that limit there what  
 would you really want to make in your  
 own business oh I don't know just some  
 more  
 money need your question ask too fast no  
 time for them to internalize what I'm  
 asking surface level  
 response but because I pasted it out  
 they did what hang on to every word  
 question I'm asking I'm causing their  
 brain to do  
 that did you see what I did when I  
 walked out on stage here when I sat in  
 silence for 30  
 seconds what did that do in your  
 mind it caused you to pay  
 attention that's a pattern interrupt I  
 did that on purpose to show you it  
 caused all of you to put your phones  
 down or to like sit here like what's  
 going on I don't it's like a mystery I  
 don't know what's happening and it  
 caused you to hone into me now I'd come  
 on here and jumped and shouted and and  
 hey that's cool and like hey I'm so  
 excited to be here you might have kind  
 of tuned out cuz you're used to that but  
 I interrupted your  
 pattern a magician never tells you  
 Secrets I just told you that see what I  
 did that's exactly why I did that  
 pattern righted okay all right let's  
 keep moving on now let's say they're  
 like oh you know if I could make 6,000 a  
 month I'd be happy now what is your  
 average price of your product like 5  
 grand for you guys is somebody going to  
 spend invest 5 grand to make six grand a  
 month maybe but that's not much of a gap  
 because if they're already making four  
 or five and they say I want to make six  
 see how that gap's much smaller so how  
 do I get them to have a bigger Gap in  
 their mind of what they really want to  
 make if I'm focused on bringing them  
 into my business I mean is that your  
 ideal income or would you rather make  
 more oh no I'd really rather make more  
 but what do you really want to make see  
 what I just did oh if I could make  
 $150,000 a year that'd be great see how  
 I just did what built a bigger Gap the  
 bigger the Gap the more likely they are  
 to take more funds to invest with you  
 the smaller the Gap the more money  
 objections you are guaranteed to get you  
 see the difference there all right I'm  
 going to show you more of this when we  
 get through the training all right and  
 then I might say Okay so the reason why  
 okay I just showed you that there you go  
 right there okay the reason why I asked  
 you that is I I really only work you  
 know look for someone who wants to make  
 I don't know I mean at least a $100,000  
 a year I mean are you are you open to  
 making that type of money oh yeah for  
 sure but what do you really want to make  
 oh man if I could make 200 that'd be  
 great so with what you're doing right  
 now like between you and Mary's income  
 combined how close are you to making  
 200,000 every single year oh yeah we're  
 about halfway there so if you stay in  
 that job just be completely real with me  
 how many years would it take you before  
 you yourself were making 200,000 every  
 single year just yourself there's no way  
 I could do that what did I just  
 do build a huge gap and he just he or  
 she just said if I stay with what I do  
 there's no way I can get to what I said  
 I just  
 wanted who's persuading who they're  
 persuading themselves see how I'm doing  
 that now I'm going to show you a lot  
 more don't worry I'm just giving you  
 little warm up here all right give me a  
 little warm up all right consequence  
 questions oh maybe  
 yes right there now this is all going to  
 be on your sales structure you see you  
 now way more than this I just gave you a  
 little hint here just getting you a  
 little bit excited internally before we  
 get into the real  
 training cuz you're going to need to  
 know everything to say before this and  
 after and you're going to need to know  
 how to reactiv it doesn't go your way  
 cuz it doesn't necessarily go this way  
 100% of the  
 time unless you want to sound like a  
 scripted robot which I definitely would  
 not encourage that CU you they will  
 emotionally shut down if they sound like  
 if you sound like a robot  
 okay got  
 it be a lot more okay consequence  
 questions helps the prospect see what  
 the consequences are if they don't do  
 anything about solving their problem  
 okay now let's take a look at this  
 how many of this how many of you ever  
 get a call or an email from a prospect  
 that you thought was really really  
 interested and they say this hey we  
 really liked you you get an email hey we  
 really liked you and what you had to say  
 in that webinar thing you had to go to  
 us the opportunity but we decided just  
 not a good time for us to start this now  
 keep in  
 touch how many of you get something like  
 that we really like the presentation the  
 water it makes so much sense but it's  
 just not it's just not a good time for  
 us right now but keep in touch and what  
 do you  
 do call them back try to argue like no  
 you need to start this now because you  
 can make more money and you how many of  
 those do you  
 win little okay you want me to show you  
 what to do okay well first of all when I  
 train you later today I'm going to show  
 you how to build such a big gap that  
 this hardly ever happens because instead  
 of just giving you Band-Aids I'd rather  
 just solve the problem from even  
 happening in their mind okay I give  
 bandaid right now okay so I'm going to  
 say something like this I might call  
 them hey John yeah that's not a problem  
 I got your I got your message I  
 completely understand um can I can I ask  
 you  
 something what did I just do there can I  
 can I ask you something notice I Pace it  
 out rather than saying let me ask you a  
 question and then ask a question oh wow  
 see how I steamroll in there they're  
 like uh can I can I ask you something  
 what what does my tone just communicate  
 with  
 that  
 concern now because my tone communicates  
 that I'm concerned he or she is always  
 going be like yeah what's going on I  
 automatically with my concern tone  
 seated there's might be something going  
 on here they don't know see how my tone  
 communicates can I can I ask you  
 something yeah go ahead then I'm going  
 to say this now they're open I'm going  
 to say how can I communicate to  
 you that you might be making a mistake  
 without you getting upset with me sure  
 Jeremy what did you have in  
 mind hear my tone again how can I  
 communicate to you that you might be  
 making a  
 mistake without you getting upset with  
 me now what type of tone did I just use  
 concern the prospect interprets my  
 intention to that question is what I'm  
 concerned for their situation which  
 emotionally does what opens them up to  
 re-engage opens them up to become more  
 open and now if they're open is it  
 easier for me to help them overcome and  
 find out what the real concern is rather  
 than throwing out a rebuttal hoping and  
 praying it's going to work you see see  
 how I set that up okay we'll go through  
 a lot more of that in the training all  
 right now if you guys want more  
 questions like this I'm going to give  
 you this QR code you can join one of our  
 free Facebook groups that's called sales  
 I'm going to leave this open for 9  
 seconds so you better get on that real  
 quick that's a QR code join you're  
 welcome to join one of our free Facebook  
 groups some of you are probably in it it  
 sounds like sales Revolution dopro and  
 tell them you saw me at this speaking  
 engagement and we will give you if you  
 don't have this it's called the npq  
 blackbook of questions we will give that  
 to you for free we only charge like 30  
 bucks for it but we'll give that to you  
 for free but just tell them you saw me  
 at this event that is the QR code to  
 join the free Facebook group I'm going  
 to give you 7 Seconds 7 six 6 5 4 3 2 1  
 Z all right now let's keep going step  
 number three is probably the most  
 important that I can show you and that's  
 eliminating sales resistance okay so how  
 do you go from where you are to becoming  
 the trusted Authority in your prospect's  
 mind because in every conversation  
 you're having it's all about  
 neutralizing the hidden pressure the  
 sales pressure that's in the  
 conversations in the DMS in person on  
 the phone on Zoom doesn't matter it's  
 about neutralizing that hidden pressure  
 I already showed you a few things to do  
 that now raise your hand if you've ever  
 heard of the ABCs of closing ever  
 anybody ever watched this movie Glenn  
 Gary Glenn Ross it's like from the 1980s  
 or 90s like a really old movie raise  
 your hand if you've ever seen this if  
 anybody comes from a sales background  
 it's like this is something you're  
 forced to watch it's like they're like  
 watch this show you know  
 now let me do  
 this how can I communicate to  
 you that the Mantra of always be closing  
 pressure pressure  
 pressure is actually causing you to lose  
 sales and  
 recruits that you should be making y  
 that our clients who are in your  
 industry make every single day now how  
 can I communicate that to you without  
 you getting angry with  
 me see what I just did okay you see that  
 Mantra is what average sales people do  
 in our day and age now that doesn't mean  
 you get to the end and you're like well  
 um if you're interested uh I guess just  
 email me  
 back you think I made multiple seven  
 figures a year in this industry and  
 three others by not  
 closing okay there has to be a middle  
 ground okay more like an expert you see  
 selling if you want to be a top 1%  
 earner in this industry selling is not  
 adversarial it is not you against the  
 prospect trying to win them over and  
 manipulate them so you can make  
 money you will play the numbers game if  
 you do that I can assure you okay  
 selling is collaborative it's you  
 working with the prospect to help them  
 find and solve problems  
 to get where they want to go  
 now here's what we're going to focus  
 instead on later today we're going to  
 learn the abds of selling that stands  
 for always be disarming from the very  
 first words out of your mouth to the  
 questions you ask and how you use your  
 tone we're continually getting our  
 prospects to let their guard down and  
 keep their guard down because when you  
 learn how to detach yourself from the  
 sale now that doesn't mean you're not  
 trying to get the sale but you want to  
 keep that internally you want to keep it  
 to yourself right because the moment you  
 go external with you trying to close the  
 deal the prospect does what they feel it  
 they feel the attachment their guard  
 goes up and now you're competing against  
 the Wall of Resistance so if we want  
 them to keep their guard down we have to  
 detach ourselves and when you do that  
 what happens psychologically is you  
 remove the sales pressure from that  
 conversation where the prospect feels it  
 is a natural conversation now it is not  
 a natural winging it conversation  
 talking about the weather and who won  
 the game and Bs it is a very skilled  
 conversation and the prospect doesn't  
 know what's going on but they  
 emotionally open up because of your  
 skill level now remember when I asked  
 some of you like I pretended to be like  
 a Network marketer and I'm like hey you  
 know why should I switch to your company  
 I've got a good comp plan remember the  
 three people that I had come up here to  
 do that do you want me to show you what  
 I would do if somebody said that okay  
 cuz I had a lot of people that would do  
 that when I was in network marketing I'm  
 like I need to develop something to get  
 them to let their guard down so I'm  
 going to show you how to do this  
 now what do most Distributors  
 do does this sound  
 familiar why should I go with you oh  
 well Amisha go with us because we're the  
 number one company in the industry we  
 have the best products our Founders have  
 the most Integrity we've been around for  
 a long time we've got the best C plan  
 our companies a AAA rated the BBB our  
 products are the safest we have the best  
 this we have the best is w w w w w w  
 w so instead of telling them and trying  
 to sell them on why you're the best why  
 not try finding out why they even ask  
 you the question in the first place what  
 is behind the  
 question see where we're going with this  
 so when the prospect says  
 this let's get them to let their guard  
 down okay now do we know we can help  
 them yes do they know we can help them  
 within the first 30 seconds of a  
 conversation we have zero trust and zero  
 credibility no so what is my first job  
 to admit that I might not be able to  
 help them which some of you like no  
 Jeremy oh my God you're going to lose a  
 sale if you admit that now I know by the  
 end of that conversation I'm going to  
 start building such a big gap because  
 I've got them to let their guard down  
 that by the end they're going to tell me  
 why the comp plan why the company why my  
 opportunity is way better for them than  
 what they said 20 minutes ago  
 sucked okay okay so let me show you now  
 here's what I'm going to have you do all  
 right who who did I use who was the can  
 I have one of the three that I brought  
 up on stage come back up here real quick  
 one of the three that I brought up on  
 stage who was  
 it one of the  
 three  
 okay so why don't we why don't we just  
 do it out here I'm going to give you a  
 microphone real quick okay so why don't  
 you why don't you give me that thing I'm  
 talking to and you're like hey you know  
 why should you know I've got a good comp  
 plan like why should I go with you  
 something like that now for you guys I  
 want you to pay attention to my  
 tone I want you to pay attention to my  
 body  
 language and I want when you feel the  
 pressure go out of the  
 room when I do this I want you to raise  
 your hand soon as you feel the pressure  
 start leaving the  
 conversation raise your hand hopefully I  
 can memorize this what's your name Mason  
 Mason okay give it to me baby so why  
 should I buy your product what what  
 makes you better than the competition  
 well maybe I mean maybe nothing you know  
 I'm not quite sure that you should even  
 do anything yet you know we we'd have to  
 understand like with your comp plan I'd  
 have to understand a little bit more  
 about kind of How It's laid out as far  
 as what they're paying you and maybe  
 kind of the results you're getting that  
 especially from your downline to kind of  
 see what that Gap looks like um I would  
 say just to see if you even help because  
 I mean you might even be better off just  
 staying with who you already have are  
 you with me on that yeah something like  
 that now let's do that again I'm going  
 to do a different angle okay say say uh  
 instead of saying about the product say  
 um well why should we go with your  
 company I'm pretty happy with who I have  
 why should we go with your company I'm  
 pretty happy where I'm at well I just so  
 you know I'm not quite sure you should  
 yet you know we we'd have to understand  
 more about kind of what you're doing  
 with the company as far as the comp plan  
 and kind of what they're kind of what  
 they're paying you compared to maybe  
 where you're wanting that to be um  
 because you might be better off staying  
 with who you already have are you maybe  
 a opposed to having a brief conversation  
 around  
 it okay all right now what did I do  
 there tones a little bit off why would I  
 say well I'm not quite sure that you  
 should yet  
 why would I say that what does that  
 do now notice how I paused about 2  
 seconds why would I pause why not say  
 well I'm not quite sure that you should  
 yet I'd have to understand more about  
 the comp plan you have with them shows  
 your yeah it's like a script he doesn't  
 have any time to internalize that but  
 when I say well I'm not quite sure that  
 you should yet now don't wait 12 seconds  
 because then he'll be like what about  
 this what about that I want to wait  
 about two well I'm not quite sure that  
 you should yet you know what they're  
 going to  
 do they'll just deflate it's like a  
 football like you just like a noodle  
 they'll just deflate I'm not quite sure  
 that you should yet you know I'd have to  
 understand you know more about the comp  
 plan you have with them and maybe the  
 results you're getting from it look at  
 the products I mean you're fairly decent  
 company because you might be better off  
 just staying with them are you with me  
 on that now why would I say because you  
 might be better off just staying with  
 them what does that  
 do cuz some of you like no Jeremy don't  
 say that you're just you're reinforcing  
 that he should go ahead them make the  
 decision well I'm going to help them  
 make that decision yeah but I have to  
 get them to let their guard down if I  
 cannot get them to let their guard down  
 there's probably no sale that's going to  
 happen I know that I can help them but  
 he doesn't know that I have zero trust  
 and credibility with him right now he  
 doesn't know me right I just started  
 talking to him 30 seconds ago how can I  
 how can I have any trust with this  
 person okay so I want to get him to let  
 his guard down and as I'm in that  
 conversation asking more questions and  
 seeding doubt  
 I'm doing what building a gap from where  
 he is to now where he sees he can be and  
 now he becomes really open to what I'm  
 talking about now why not say are you  
 open to talking about that why would I  
 say are you opposed because remember  
 you're supposed to get them to say yes  
 17  
 times everybody wants to say no so I'm  
 just using it to his benefit and mine  
 are you opposed to having a conversation  
 yes I'm opposed hard for them to say yes  
 I'm opposed then say no I'm not really  
 open see how I'm changing a word are you  
 opposed to having a conversation no I'm  
 not opposed what do you have in it's  
 hard for them to say yes I'm opposed  
 they're all going to say no I'm not  
 opposed what do you have in mind see I'm  
 mismatching okay thank you very much  
 well done there can I have the  
 microphone  
 \[Applause\]  
 okay all right couple last things we're  
 going to wrap up before the training all  
 right anybody raise your hand ever get  
 an A typee personality hard to open up  
 surface level cards to their chest poker  
 face no emotion you know they have  
 problems but they're just staying  
 surface level and then what objections  
 do you get at the  
 end can you think about it research more  
 information talk to my spouse talk to my  
 CPA I need to talk with my mom to see if  
 it's a good  
 investment I need to talk with my uncle  
 in Georgia about what okay okay now  
 here's a technique to  
 use so let's say I'm three4 in the  
 conversation I can't get them to open up  
 this is like my last thing I can do um  
 Mary can I can I ask you something sure  
 go ahead between you know you and I and  
 let's say off the Record what's the real  
 reason why you might be looking to start  
 your own business  
 well and then they tell you between you  
 and I and you know off the record why  
 would I say off the  
 Record remember when a journalist is  
 interviewing somebody they're like hey  
 this is going to be off the Record  
 what's really going on no trust so I'm  
 saying off the record between you and I  
 you know off the Record what's the main  
 reason why you might be looking to start  
 your own business well the reason see

 know how to help them overcome the I  
 want to think it over objection which is  
 actually not an objection we'll talk  
 about that later but let's say you don't  
 know what to do yet okay you can do the  
 same thing this is like your last resort  
 um now you always want to say there you  
 want to say Can hey can I can I ask you  
 something like concern time can I can I  
 ask you something sure go ahead what's

 between you and I and you know off the  
 Record what's really holding you back  
 from moving forward so you can make more  
 money and what do I do with my  
 hand why did I put on my chest what does  
 that signify what does that communicate  
 in my body language compassion that I'm  
 concerned that I care for her now she  
 sees that or even if she doesn't see it  
 cuz I'm on the phone that affects my  
 tone and my tone causes her to interpret  
 that I'm asking that question because  
 I'm concerned for her situation when she  
 feels I'm concerned she's way more  
 inclined to what open up and tell me  
 what's holding her back from notice how  
 I didn't say what's really holding you  
 back from signing up with  
 me I said the end result what's really  
 holding you back from moving forward so  
 you can make more money for your family  
 notice I'm putting in the end result of  
 starting the business with you to make  
 more money for the family see what I'm  
 doing there I'm getting them into  
 results based thinking you with me on  
 that all right all right here's what we  
 went over three steps to becoming the  
 trusted Authority in your prospect's  
 mind becoming a problem finder and  
 solver not a product Pusher that's no  
 bueno number two asking the right  
 questions but at the right time give you  
 a few examples of the right tone and  
 then eliminating sales resistance all  
 right now you guys want this book here  
 is the thing I think a lot of you had it  
 cuz I've signed a lot of books I will do  
 my best to sign your book while I'm here

 but I will do my best so what we're  
 going to do does anybody want those  
 slides I told um I I I told some people  
 I would do this for you so what I'm  
 going to do if you want the book that's  
 at Barnes & Noble you can buy it from  
 Barnes & Noble that's the link do not  
 buy it from Amazon if I find out if you  
 bought it from Amazon I'm not signing it

 deal with Barnes & Noble

 Noble so if you need a GoFundMe link to

 $17 so you can sell more to make more  
 money let us know we'll get you a  
 GoFundMe link but there's the thing I'm  
 going to give you up 10 seconds now what  
 you're going to do is take a picture of

 going on okay now remember I want to go  
 over this last quote that changed  
 everything for me and it can change  
 everything for you because right now  
 this is just a start of what we're going  
 to do remember what Tony said you will  
 fail for the simple reason you don't  
 learn the right  
 skills who has complete control of  
 acquiring the right skills  
 you  
 do take control of your business of your  
 financial situation and develop right  
 sys because what is the biggest expense  
 in your life right now what is your  
 biggest expense in your life is it your  
 mortgage is it your taxes is it all that  
 well those are expenses but your biggest  
 expense in life is your lack of  
 knowledge your biggest expense in life  
 right now that you have is your lack of  
 knowledge of not knowing the right  
 questions not knowing the right things  
 to say not understanding how to use your  
 tone to help you make at least what does  
 everybody want to make at least 350,000  
 a year in this business 500,000 see  
 that's your biggest expense right now  
 that's your biggest expense in life that  
 you have so once you acquire those  
 skills what becomes  
 possible  
 everything okay thanks  
 everybody

\# Scientifically Proven Steps to Building Rapport with Anyone in Sales  
\# https://www.youtube.com/watch/PkCDXJooFmk

 tired of getting like punched in your  
 nose slapped in your face from your  
 prospects even in the first 30 seconds  
 one minute two minutes of the sales  
 calls or appointments you're in well  
 that's you today I'm going to give you  
 four count them four scientifically  
 proven questions that actually trigger  
 your prospect to open up to you and want  
 to engage and put you on the path to  
 building massive trust in that  
 prospect's brain first of all go down to  
 the bottom of this video hit the  
 Subscribe button that's probably  
 important for you hit the Subscribe  
 button and to the right of that or maybe  
 the left I don't know somewhere in there  
 there's like a little bell that's your  
 notifications button hit the  
 notifications Button as well so you get  
 notified by YouTube Every time I post a  
 new training video which I typically do  
 two to four times a week all right now  
 these are called napq  
 okay I'm going to change my thing up  
 here a little bit thicker these are  
 called any PQ  
 connecting questions all right now  
 connecting questions now if you're not  
 familiar with the nepq methodology that  
 stands for neural emotional persuasion  
 questioning all right so the first part  
 of that is connecting questions so how  
 do we take the focus off you in a  
 conversation and get it onto that  
 Prospect like right in the first few  
 seconds that's what we're going to talk  
 about today now realize this this is  
 Behavioral Science 101 within the first  
 7 to 12 seconds of any sales interaction  
 you're in I don't care if you sell  
 door-to-door if you sell b2c in a  
 prospect's home or on Zoom virtually or  
 if you maybe are in more of a complex  
 sound environment B2B and you're selling  
 in an office or maybe virtually as well  
 on Zoom your prospects are picking up on  
 your social cues okay based on your  
 tonality so your verbal and non-verbal  
 cues based on your tonality your body  
 language and what you are saying and or  
 asking that actually is triggering their  
 brain to respond and react in one of two  
 ways okay this is very scary if you  
 don't know the difference now if you  
 come across aggressive in the first part  
 of that conversation you know what I  
 mean by that if you come across overly  
 excited okay you're enthusiastic okay  
 and I'm not saying boring but you come  
 across too excited and you come across  
 needy and attached that's no bueno and  
 you don't understand the right questions  
 asked especially the right tone it  
 actually triggers the human brain to go  
 into what's called fight or flight mode  
 now everybody's heard that right you've  
 heard that but do you know what's  
 triggering it in your prospect's brain  
 okay there's certain things you're  
 saying or in how you're saying it that's  
 triggering them to react that way and  
 that's when the prospect says like if  
 you're cold calling not interested we  
 already have somebody for that or if you  
 get onto an inbound lead or something  
 like that or an outbound name they're  
 like oh we already have somebody for  
 that or you know what I don't have a lot  
 of time for your quest questions just  
 tell me how much it's going to cost on  
 tape I'm interested or you know what I  
 don't have a lot of time can you just  
 email me a quote or email me a proposal  
 and I'll get back to you okay how many  
 of you go through that all right now I'm  
 going to show you how to eliminate that  
 today okay now once you learn what we  
 call anypq even with these four  
 questions I'm going to give you today  
 it's going to give you a start you're  
 going to notice when you come across  
 more let's say unbiased more neutral  
 like you're not quite sure if you can  
 even help yet you don't know what's  
 going on you don't know anything about  
 their situation you're not saying that  
 exactly but that's the vibe you're  
 coming across okay you come across more  
 Collective more calm and especially  
 detached that's the keyword detached and  
 you understand the right questions to  
 ask which I'm going to give you some  
 samples here and you understand the  
 right Tone It triggers their brain to  
 become curious enough where they  
 actually want to engage they want to  
 open up to you because they feel  
 comfortable enough okay they don't feel  
 like you're a threat to them you're not  
 triggering fight or flight mode right so  
 I'm going to give you some examples of  
 how that works today with these  
 connecting questions let's go to the  
 next page here all right now  
 let's say in this example I'm going to  
 give you an example of calling outbound  
 leads and then I'm going to give you  
 example of calling inbound leads so in  
 our definition we train 158 different  
 Industries on planners pretty much every  
 industry that is out there except  
 underwater basket weaving if you know  
 somebody in underwater basket weaving  
 let us know I'm joking all right so in  
 those Industries an outbound lead to us  
 and most of our clients means somebody  
 has responded to an ad maybe on Facebook  
 YouTube Google whatever or they've  
 called into your company and left their  
 information and they're wanting somebody  
 to call them back now they don't know  
 who's calling back or when but they've  
 left their name email and phone number  
 somebody they know is calling them back  
 that is considered an outbound lead or  
 maybe your company buys leads from lead  
 vendors that have expressed some type of  
 interest in what you're doing some way  
 and you're calling them back that's  
 considered an outbound lead not cold  
 calling all right I'll give cold calling  
 examples at a different time now inbound  
 leads in our book is somebody that's  
 booked on your calendar all right maybe  
 they booked on your calendar you're  
 going to show up on Zoom with them or  
 some type of app virtual app or maybe  
 they've booked on the counter for you to  
 come to their home or to their office  
 building whatever you sell either b2c or  
 B2B so this first example I'm going to  
 give you is an outbound lead example now  
 I'm going to give you the framework here  
 but I'm going to show you in a couple of  
 different industry specific examples so  
 you can see how that structure works  
 like okay does it matter what you sell I  
 can pretty much assure you that we are  
 training tons of sales people and or  
 companies in your industry that are  
 making two three five times what you're  
 making right now because of what I'm  
 about to show you along with other  
 things as well okay so let me I'm going  
 to go through this and I'm going to role  
 play with it so you can actually hear my  
 tonality because that's very important  
 all right so let's say that this is an  
 outbound lead okay and you're calling  
 them in this example let's say you sell  
 B2B so you're mainly selling uh to like  
 SMB type of companies like smaller  
 companies and let's say in this example  
 you're a lead vendor and you're selling  
 leads to those companies and their  
 biggest problem is maybe the quality of  
 their leads they're getting now is not  
 so good maybe they're not getting enough  
 leads it could be a lot of various  
 factors right so we're going to tie in  
 that to our opening statements so they  
 we're going to call them okay yeah hi is  
 Mary there oh hey hey Mary it's just uh  
 John Smith uh with XYZ company  
 um you had recently responded uh to one  
 of our ads it looks like it was uh  
 yesterday morning I think you maybe saw  
 something on YouTube about getting a  
 higher quality lead to like your sales  
 people so that you could like scale and  
 grow the business right okay that's a  
 question they're gonna be like yeah  
 right or yeah I think I did I'm not  
 quite sure okay then you're gonna go now  
 hey I was curious like when you when you  
 saw when you went through the ad or when  
 you saw the ad where you saw X and Y and  
 Z point out something they would have  
 saw an ad where you saw X and Y and Z  
 what I guess what was it about the ad  
 that attracted your attention Okay see  
 how that works now I'll give you another  
 example of how to start this out there's  
 different examples that we use on  
 different Industries Jesus Mary hey yeah  
 Mary it's just John Smith with XYZ  
 company  
 um you it looks like you had asked us to  
 call you back you responded to one of  
 our ads looks like it was this morning  
 about getting a a higher quality lead to  
 your sales people so you could grow the  
 business and I just had time to get back  
 to you to see if I could help did I get  
 you at a bad time you never want to say  
 did I get you a good time okay because a  
 lot of people like no you got me at a  
 bad time but if I say did I get you at a  
 bad time most of the time they're like  
 no it's not a bad time or I can say did  
 I get you an appropriate time or if you  
 don't want to use that because you  
 haven't learned the right tonality you  
 can do this so that you could really  
 grow in and scaled the business now I  
 should probably start off by asking you  
 have you have you found what you're  
 looking for or are you still looking for  
 like a higher quality lead so you could  
 really grow the company oh no I'm still  
 looking okay and do you know what you're  
 looking for see there's different  
 examples of how you can do that outbound  
 Nate or you can do what I just showed  
 you right here now let's go to the next  
 page so after we do that those are the  
 first two connecting questions we then  
 want to establish a what's called a  
 status frame this is an nepq okay status  
 frame now this is very important  
 because a lot of times sales people and  
 and really in any industry we found b2cm  
 B2B is they'll set some type of frame  
 right where they say and towards the end  
 of the call you know if you find that  
 this this fits into what you're looking  
 for and we feel you're a good fit for  
 our company you know we can do XYZ now  
 the problem is is that most salespeople  
 are saying that on every single sales  
 call okay so when you say and we'll see  
 if you're a good fit for our company  
 do you really believe your prospects  
 believe if they hand you their credit  
 card and say I want to buy I'll buy it  
 whatever it costs you're like nope nope  
 you're not a good fit for our company uh  
 we're gonna have to not accept your  
 money everybody knows that that's not  
 the reality So when you say things like  
 that it actually triggers them to trust  
 you less you lower your status in their  
 brain so we still want to have a frame  
 where they know that there could be  
 possible next steps at the end we don't  
 want them to think that they can just  
 think about it for months on end right  
 now if you're selling B2B it's a little  
 bit different I'm going to show you a  
 couple tweaks there as well all right so  
 so after you do that last connecting  
 question you're going to go back yeah  
 and really John the the first part of of  
 this call it's it's pretty basic it's  
 it's really more for us to find about  
 cut all right let's start that over  
 so you'll start right here so yeah John  
 the first part of this call it's it's  
 really basic it's it's really more for  
 us to find out kind of you know what you  
 do to generate leads now and like the  
 quality of that lead and kind of the  
 results you're you're getting from it  
 compared to the results that you're  
 really after just to see what that Gap  
 looks like to see if we can help and  
 then towards the end of the call if  
 you'd like I can go over some different  
 options and if you feel that you know  
 that it might be what you're looking for  
 we can talk about possible next steps  
 would that help you now let me analyze  
 and break down what I just did there  
 this is really important okay so we're  
 just going to say the first part of this  
 call the first part of this meeting is  
 pretty basic now why would I want to  
 downplay it okay I want to downplay it  
 because I want to lower their resistance  
 if I get into like assumptive mode  
 especially if I'm selling a high priced  
 item it's maybe a little bit different  
 you're selling a five dollar you know  
 subscription to a magazine it's a little  
 bit different more transactional sales I  
 want to get them to let their guard down  
 so when I downplay things it relaxes the  
 prospect okay it triggers them when I  
 downplay something they more uplit like  
 they up it when I up play it and get  
 excited most people downplay it just the  
 way human behavior works when we push  
 people push back right see how that  
 works it's pretty basic it's more for us  
 to find out kind of what you do to now  
 in this example I'm this is the same  
 framework for any industry I'm just  
 showing you an industry specific example  
 you so you can see the break so it's  
 really how to generate what you're doing  
 to generate leads now like the quality  
 of the lead the the volume and then what  
 type of results you're getting compared  
 to what you want to be at so we can kind  
 of see what that Gap looks like did you  
 see so even if I'm calling on the phone  
 and they can't see me I still want to  
 use these hand movements because it  
 affects what it affects my tone it  
 affects the way my voice is being  
 portrayed to that Prospect if I just sit  
 there and do it like this I sound like a  
 scripted robot now especially if they  
 can see you let's say you're on Zoom  
 virtually they can see you you're in  
 their home maybe you're in their office  
 building or on the door it doesn't  
 matter you especially want them to start  
 visualizing in their mind that Gap so  
 I'm already starting to do that now  
 notice my hand signals I'm going to show  
 you this again like the type of leads  
 that you're getting now you know the  
 type of leads you're getting now let's  
 go back here so the so kind of how you  
 generate leads now like the the quality  
 of those leads kind of the the results  
 you might be getting see how I'm  
 lowering that the results you might be  
 getting compared to the results that you  
 want to be at  
 see how I just built that Gap visually  
 in their brain  
 just so we can kind of see what that Gap  
 looks like to see if we can help and  
 then now this is important here notice  
 how I'm going to be neutral here I'm not  
 going to be overly assumpted because you  
 haven't built any trust and credibility  
 in the first 45 seconds of a  
 conversation it'd be impossible to  
 so what you want to do here and then  
 towards the end of the call if you if  
 you feel that it you know that it might  
 be see might be is a neutral word two  
 words might be what you're looking for  
 we can talk about possible next steps  
 see how possible is a neutral word okay  
 that triggers them to let their guard  
 down nobody's ever going to say nope it  
 would not be appropriate to talk about  
 possible next steps like they're not  
 going to say that okay if I assume and  
 towards the end of the call if you feel  
 like you really really want this and  
 it's a good fit I'm going to show you  
 how to pay us then that triggers more  
 resistance bro whoa I didn't say I was  
 going to buy yet that's what you'll get  
 with a lot of prospects especially a  
 type personalities right this lowers  
 their guard now let's move into that  
 last connecting question now I was  
 curious like what were you what were you  
 hoping to get out of the call with us  
 today just so I have a better  
 understanding what were you hoping yeah  
 and what were you hoping to get out of  
 the call of this today just so I have a  
 better understanding well I just want to  
 know what the options are maybe the  
 price points they might say that oh yeah  
 and just agree oh yeah yeah we'll go  
 through all that for sure now just so  
 you're aware we don't have like you know  
 one price point one package there's  
 multiple different options and once I  
 you know probably ask a few questions  
 around you know what you're using now  
 and the results you're getting compared  
 to where you want to be once I  
 understand that I can go over the  
 different options we have for our  
 clients if that helps you and they're  
 gonna yeah sure go ahead all right  
 that's for an outbound name now I'm  
 going to show you the difference with an  
 inbound lead okay this is a little bit  
 different here  
 let's say that you're on zoom in this  
 example right it's a little bit  
 different in your if you're in the  
 office or the home you're not going to  
 say hey can you hear me yeah can you see  
 me right that's what you would do  
 virtually you would say that and then  
 instead of asking like oh how are you  
 doing today oh good yeah and where do  
 you live oh you live in Atlanta yeah I  
 live here in Dallas Texas like I love  
 Atlanta I was there two weeks ago with  
 my daughter see your prospects know  
 that you are genuinely not interested in  
 how their damn day is going now you  
 might be one out of a million sales  
 people that really are interested in how  
 their day is going and want to hear them  
 for the next 20 minutes but your  
 prospects don't believe you are and why  
 is that because you're used to every  
 salesperson who's ever tried to sell  
 them anything ask them how are you doing  
 today or how your day's going with most  
 Prospect just so you know  
 psychologically the data shows that they  
 trust you less when you ask questions  
 that every other salesperson always ask  
 them because they associate you with all  
 the negative experiences they've always  
 had with sales people you don't want to  
 be in that camp right if you want to  
 make the sale so what's your new hey can  
 you hear me okay I can hear you you look  
 down at your notes and say okay so all  
 right John so you know welcome to the to  
 you know be on here with me today it  
 looks like you had booked on the  
 calendar and let's say in this example  
 you sell life insurance or mortgage  
 protection so I'm giving you a couple  
 different industry specific examples so  
 you can just see how it works okay just  
 plug that in with what you sell okay  
 looks like you had booked on the  
 calendar about looking at at possible  
 financial protection for like your your  
 mortgage and your family when something  
 does happen to you right and they'll be  
 like right so looks like you'd booked on  
 the calendar about looking at possible  
 we're going to say financial protection  
 for that industry for your home and  
 family when something does happen to you  
 right so I'm associating the call with  
 the end result remember we have to get  
 each of your prospects to go from cost  
 or price based thinking to results-based  
 thinking and that's when you have you  
 can sell a lot more if they if they're  
 thinking result space thinking over  
 price or cost it's easy to sell if you  
 get them into cost or price-based  
 thinking you're going to get a lot of  
 money objections you don't want to have  
 to get into that chasing mode you don't  
 have to okay they're like they're gonna  
 say yeah right now if it's on a phone  
 call if you're calling it's a little bit  
 different for an inbound Nate hey is  
 John there yeah John it's just uh James  
 Taylor calling you you you had asked us  
 to call it looks like you had booked now  
 on the calendar about looking at you  
 know possible financial protection for  
 like your mortgage payment every month  
 and the family uh when something does  
 happen to you right  
 see how I'm curious I'm calm I'm relaxed  
 I'm not overly enthusiastic but I'm not  
 boring you have to be there in the  
 middle now here's where we're going to  
 go into the frame for an inbound lead  
 all right yeah and John I would say the  
 the first part of the the meeting I mean  
 it's it's pretty basic it's really more  
 for us to find out you know what you  
 might be eligible for like kind of maybe  
 what you have in place now when  
 something does happen to you you know  
 compared to what you might be looking  
 for as far as like you know coverage for  
 the family just to see what that Gap  
 looks like to see if we can help and  
 then you know towards the end of the  
 call I can go over some options if you  
 want me to and if you feel that it that  
 it might be what you're looking for we  
 can talk about possible next steps does  
 that help you  
 yeah sure what do you have okay same  
 thing first part of this call meeting is  
 pretty basic it's really more for us to  
 find out what you might be eligible for  
 now look at my hands what you know what  
 find out what you might be eligible for  
 kind of what you have in place now  
 compared to what you might be looking  
 for notice how I'm building a gap with  
 my hands okay so we can see what that  
 Gap looks like to see if we can help and  
 then towards the end of the call I can  
 go over some options if you'd like and  
 if you feel that it might be what you're  
 looking for notice might be what you're  
 looking for again we can talk we can  
 discuss uh possible next steps does that  
 help you possible next steps see how  
 we're doing it now we're going into the  
 next two questions now I I was curious  
 though but before I kind of ask you  
 about what you have now when you went  
 through the letter that you got in the  
 mail or when you saw the ad online what

\# Get them to COMMIT in Sales: What to Say to Prospect  
\# https://www.youtube.com/watch/S7BZVrwHVKI

 prospect says  
 hey we'll uh we'll get back to you for  
 interested what do you do then what do  
 you say what do you ask or do you just  
 quiver up and just hope and pray they do  
 see this is a common objection you can  
 get in two stages of the sales process  
 you can get this very early in the sales  
 conversation or you can actually get it  
 at the end of the sales conversation and  
 or sales process depending on if you  
 sell b2c b2b now first of all we need to  
 make sure that we do not come across  
 as a desperate sales person and just  
 agree to let them get back to us or say  
 something like oh can i call you later  
 today and then you just randomly call  
 them later and as you know they never  
 answer if they said that like if you  
 called and said hey you responded to xyz  
 ad oh hey yeah i'll just i'll have to  
 call you back later if i'm interested or  
 can you call me back later if i'm  
 interested so you never just lower your  
 status and agree to call them back okay  
 why do you not want to do that because  
 when you do that it lowers your status  
 with a prospect as they start to view  
 you as what just another sales person  
 trying to sell them something so they  
 try to avoid you all right so let's go  
 over how to address this if they give  
 you this objection early in the  
 conversation let's say in the first 30  
 seconds to a minute and then i'm also  
 going to show you how to address it if  
 they bring it up at the end of your  
 sales process like if they say hey this  
 looks really good let me go through it  
 and we'll get back to you if we're  
 interested because there's going to be  
 some tweaks there now in this example  
 let's say you called an outbound lead  
 and in our mind an outbound lead is  
 someone who's either responded to an ad  
 online  
 maybe even a newspaper direct mail  
 doesn't matter left a phone number for  
 your company to call back  
 and they say this objection they give  
 this subjection to you within the first  
 30 seconds okay i'm going to show you  
 the prospect says hey uh yeah thanks for  
 your call james but i don't have time to  
 talk um can i just get back to you later  
 if i'm interested now  
 here's how you're going to separate  
 yourself from every other salesperson  
 what they would normally do you're going  
 to say this  
 well  
 possibly um  
 i'd have to look at my schedule to see  
 if i'd be available for you  
 now what i can do though if you have  
 your calendar handy i can pull up mine  
 that way you can book a specific time  
 with me so you don't have to chase me  
 down and vice versa  
 would that help you  
 now then you're going to book a specific  
 time later that day or the next day if  
 you book a time a week away the  
 likelihood of that prospect ever  
 remembering that and showing up is going  
 to be very very low as you know now why  
 would i just not agree to let them  
 randomly call back when they said well  
 i'm busy right now can i just call you  
 back later or can you call me back later  
 because more than likely as you know  
 they're not going to call back see  
 that's a fight or flight response that  
 they gave you when you called them so at  
 that point they're just trying to get  
 rid of you realize when we come into any  
 sales call or any sales conversation no  
 matter what you sell b to c b to b door  
 to door it doesn't matter we have to  
 first establish what's called a status  
 frame meaning that when we enter that  
 call we must get the prospect to at  
 least view us at the same level as them  
 as far as our status in the beginning of  
 that call or at least at the same level  
 now by the middle to the end of that  
 conversation we must get them to view us  
 as having a much higher status and that  
 subject we are communicating with them  
 about  
 that triggers them to view us as the  
 expert or the trusted authority that can  
 get them the results they're looking for  
 rather than viewing you as just another  
 sales person who's trying to sell them  
 something because of a lower status so  
 when they say they'll just get back to  
 us later at the beginning of a call or  
 even if they say hey can you call me  
 back later the way we establish the  
 right status frame is by simply acting  
 detached from the outcome so i want you  
 to analyze this just hold with me for a  
 second when we say well possibly  
 well possibly i'd have to look at my  
 calendar to see if i'd even be available  
 for you when we say that it starts to  
 trigger in their mind that hold on  
 this person's busy they  
 they don't need me we've got tons of  
 clients so it triggers in their brain  
 well possibly i'd have to look at my  
 schedule to see if i'd even be available  
 for you and that positions your status  
 as somebody that actually knows what  
 they're talking about they they have  
 lots of you have lots of clients you  
 don't need them you don't have to chase  
 him so it raises your status in that  
 prospect's mind therefore you might have  
 something that could be important to  
 them so especially when we say this  
 what i can do  
 if you'd like what i can do if it helps  
 you is if you have your calendar handy i  
 can pull up mine that way you can book a  
 specific time so you don't have to chase  
 me down and vice versa would that be  
 appropriate or would that help you now  
 once again that establishes a status  
 frame where they start to view you at a  
 much higher status all of a sudden  
 you're suggesting they can book a  
 specific time that way they don't have  
 to chase  
 you down do you see the difference in  
 there it gets them to think you must be  
 a successful person if others are having  
 to chase you down just to get on a call  
 about what you offer  
 so you must have something important  
 that could be important to them now if  
 the prospect does here i want to throw  
 this disclaimer out if the prospect does  
 not call you at the time they booked  
 with you then what do you do you simply  
 call them about two to three minutes  
 later what you don't want to do is right  
 at three o'clock when they're supposed  
 to call you at 303 you pick up the phone  
 and start dialing because that just  
 shows you're just sitting there all day  
 waiting to call the prospect that's  
 desperate now you don't want to call 10  
 or 20 minutes later but typically two or  
 three minutes later you never want to  
 call right on the dot because like i  
 said shows that you're desperate you're  
 waiting around to call them now let's  
 say you get this objection like hey  
 we'll take a look at it and we'll get  
 back to you for interested and you get  
 that at the end of a sales call or a  
 conversation now if you sold b2c and you  
 did a one call close it'd be different  
 than if you sold let's say b2b and  
 you're trying to set up let's say a  
 second call for a demo or a proposal or  
 whatever your next step is in your sales  
 cycle and process now let's say in this  
 example that you sold b2c okay and i'm  
 going to show you a b2b example in just  
 a minute a little bit of a difference  
 prospect says you know we really like  
 this what you offered but you know give  
 us some time and we'll get back to you  
 you know if we're interested here's what  
 you're going to say first of all  
 remember you have to disarm them you  
 have to get them to let their guard down  
 so they can really tell you  
 what the real concern is because them  
 saying they'll get back to you if we're  
 interested that's not really a concern  
 that's like waffling right so you got to  
 get them very specific what's holding  
 them back from moving forward so you say  
 yeah that's not a problem  
 so you say yeah that's not a problem now  
 what's your time frame on getting back  
 to me later today or tomorrow to see if  
 i'd be available for you so once again  
 you're going to do the same thing as we  
 did before that's why i didn't write it  
 on the board you're going to say yeah  
 that's not a problem now what's your  
 time frame on getting back to me later  
 today or tomorrow  
 just to see if i'd be available for you  
 remember positions you was busy you  
 don't need their business you got lots  
 of other clients you're detached raises  
 your status prospects well we're not  
 sure you know we just need some time to  
 really think it over aha now you're  
 starting to get closer to what the  
 actual objection is but you're not quite  
 there because i want to think it over is  
 not a real objection either is it you  
 then say this this is the calendar  
 commitment that i taught you earlier  
 where you raise your status by getting  
 them to book a specific time well what i  
 can do  
 you know joan if it helps you  
 is if you have your calendar handy  
 i can pull up mine and have you book a  
 specific time with me that way you don't  
 have to chase me down and vice versa  
 because my schedule gets pretty hectic  
 would that help you okay at this point  
 we still don't know what the real  
 concern is but at least we have a book  
 time and the prospect is disarmed and  
 letting their guard down because they  
 feel or think you're about to go you  
 might be on a zoom call you're about to  
 leave zoom you might be in the boardroom  
 you're about to leave their office you  
 might be in a home you're leaving the  
 home you might be on a call they feel  
 like you're leaving the call because you  
 booked a specific time with them for  
 another day do you see how we're  
 disarming them but we still don't know  
 what the real concern is so when a  
 prospect says give us some time and  
 we'll get back to you with an answer or  
 we'll get back to you if we're  
 interested or we need some time to think  
 about it that is not a real objection  
 the objection is behind  
 that response that they just gave you  
 it's behind that it's like hiding out  
 and they don't want to let it out  
 if you don't find out what the real  
 objection is well guess what the  
 likelihood of them getting back to you  
 is slim to none right so you would treat  
 this exactly like you would treat i want  
 to think it over objection which we have  
 that in you know our virtual training  
 courses we don't have time to go through  
 that today so after they have booked a  
 specific time with you for the next call  
 you simply ask this question to get them  
 to reveal the real concern and once  
 again they think you're leaving at this  
 point so they're more open to tell you  
 watch what we do here  
 now john before i go  
 see what i just did  
 now before i go  
 what were you wanting to go over in your  
 mind  
 just so i know what questions you might  
 have when we talk in two days  
 see let me repeat that now before i go  
 so they think you're going right so hey  
 they can tell you the truth because  
 you're about to go right they're opening  
 up now john before i go  
 what were you wanting to go over in your  
 mind  
 just so i know what questions you might  
 have when we talk tomorrow  
 now  
 this is the key see that's a much better  
 way than saying what do you want to  
 think about john  
 they're not going to tell you but what  
 do you what before i go what were you  
 wanting to go over in your mind  
 just so i know what questions you might  
 have when we talk again tomorrow now  
 this is the key because at this point  
 they're going to tell you what the real  
 concern is they might say well i'm just  
 concerned about x y and z or i'm just  
 not understanding this part of what  
 you're offering or i'm just not quite  
 sure we have the budget or the money for  
 this ah now you know what the concern is  
 the concern is not i'll think about it  
 and get back to it and answer the  
 concern about is something like a money  
 objection or they might they feel like  
 they don't have the time to implement it  
 it just depends on what you sell now  
 would you rather know what their real  
 concern is now when you're on zoom with  
 them or in person or on the phone rather  
 than not knowing and hoping and praying  
 they're going to show up to the next  
 appointment now at this point once you  
 know what the real concern is you're  
 obviously there with them you can stay  
 there clarify that concern  
 ask what's called a diffusing question  
 and then discuss it like two people who  
 are trying to work out a solution  
 together and most of the time close that  
 deal on that call or at least move them  
 forward to the next stage of the process  
 if you sold b2b example okay  
 now in this example let's say that you  
 sell b2b business to business and you're  
 trying to set up a second call to do a  
 demo  
 of your product or service whatever you  
 sell and you get the well  
 that's not necessary let me just take  
 what you've said today and and and talk  
 with everybody and we'll get back to you  
 if you're interested okay so let me give  
 an example i'm going to start in role  
 play you say this okay john good first  
 call that really gives us a better  
 understanding of kind of what's going on  
 with your company's situation  
 really the next step would be if it's  
 appropriate is we would schedule a demo  
 with your team in the hyz department to  
 go over how the xyz product would  
 actually solve the problems that you  
 brought up and kind of get you guys  
 where you're wanting to go would that  
 help you let's say you say that okay you  
 say that and the prospect says well  
 i don't know i'm not quite sure we'd  
 have time right now we're really busy  
 with everything going on why don't you  
 just get back why don't we just get back  
 to you later  
 then you say this  
 what do you say when they say that you  
 just say yeah that's not a problem you  
 just agree with it remember we have to  
 disarm the prospect if we can't disarm  
 the prospect if we can't get them to  
 lower their guard there's no way we're  
 going to move that sale forward so we  
 have to remove the sales pressure we  
 agree yeah that's not a problem and then  
 you're going to lean in and say this now  
 you're going to lean in if you're in  
 person so if you're in the home or if  
 you're selling b2b you're probably going  
 to be in their office or some type of  
 boardroom or you might be on zoom if  
 you're doing it virtually and you're  
 going to lean in or if you're on the  
 phone you're still going to lean in  
 because your body language affects what  
 your tonality and how it comes across  
 and you say this now  
 before i go  
 okay so remember  
 you're disarming them they think you're  
 going now before i go just between  
 me and you and  
 off the record now i'm not doing the  
 right tone out of here i'm just going to  
 show you now before i go just between me  
 and you and  
 off the record what's really holding you  
 back from  
 exploring this further so that you can  
 and then you're going to repeat back  
 what they said they wanted now let me  
 show you the right tonality okay i want  
 to show you how this works now john  
 before i go and just you know between  
 me and you and  
 off the record  
 what's really holding you back from  
 exploring this further so that you guys  
 can  
 and you're going to repeat back what  
 they said they wanted all right looks  
 before i go between me and you  
 remember selling is collaborative  
 between me and you we're on the same  
 team and  
 off the record always say that now you  
 can't say that three times during a  
 sales call you don't use that once  
 because then they're gonna start feeling  
 like it's a technique well  
 off the record  
 what's really holding you back you lean  
 in and whisper that see my tonality okay  
 off and between you between me and you  
 and  
 off the record and you do this off the  
 record  
 what's really holding you back  
 from exploring this further so that you  
 can  
 and then you're going to peep back what  
 they said they wanted now let's say the  
 prospect says this well we're not sure  
 about and then they tell you  
 the real concern do you see how that  
 works now let's do that over again  
 then the prospect says well we're not  
 sure about and here is where they tell  
 you what the real concern actually is  
 now depending on what their concern is  
 depends on how you address it to it at  
 this point you then once again clarify  
 it discuss it like two people working  
 together to find a solution and then you  
 defuse it then book them for the second  
 call demo second call  
 proposal whatever your second  
 step is in your sales process so that's  
 what you do  
 at the end if they say oh let's take a  
 look we'll get back to you for  
 interested  
 do that on your next sales call or  
 appointment and watch how your prospects  
 easily overcome  
 that concern and move on to the next  
 step in your sales process and that  
 is your tip for the day  
 you

\# How to Ask Good Probing Questions  
\# https://www.youtube.com/watch/7prf7vfCFx0

 so whether you sell b2c  
 business to consumer or b2b business to  
 business this training is going to help  
 you drastically all right so today i'm  
 going to give you  
 seven  
 different questions  
 that will trigger your prospect to go  
 below the surface  
 instead of staying surface level with  
 you okay so i'm going to give you seven  
 top questions  
 to help you go below the surface that's  
 going to trigger the prospect to want to  
 open up more go below the surface and  
 tell you  
 what's really going on then i'm going to  
 show you off of those seven questions  
 from their answers how to then clarify  
 their answers and probe deeper so they  
 feel more pain okay that builds more of  
 a gap because the more pain you get them  
 to feel the more gap you build from  
 where they are compared to where they  
 want to be the more likely they are  
 going to purchase your solution because  
 they want to run away from that pain and  
 actually solve it and i actually have a  
 white board vibe or i'm going to draw  
 over i'm going to pull over here in a  
 second first of all go down to the  
 bottom of this video hit the subscribe  
 button that's probably important for you  
 hit the subscribe button and to the  
 right of that or maybe the left i don't  
 know somewhere in there there's like a  
 little bell that's your notifications  
 button hit the notifications button as  
 well so you get notified by youtube  
 every time i post a new training video  
 which i typically do two to four times a  
 week all right so when let's start here  
 seven questions all right  
 i'm gonna have blake bring over the uh  
 the thing over here in just about two  
 minutes two minutes all right all right  
 so i'm going to give your preferences  
 okay so let's start off here here's the  
 first thing that we need to understand  
 when we only ask what are called surface  
 level questions okay you know what i'm  
 talking about your prospect just so you  
 understand psychologically will never  
 open up to you and actually tell you the  
 truth of what is really going on what  
 the real problems are what the root  
 cause of the problems and how those  
 problems are affecting them and why  
 won't they open up to you it's because  
 the questions you've been forced to  
 learn  
 by the gurus or maybe your company it's  
 not your fault i was forced to learn  
 them in the beginning the questions  
 you've been taught to ask most of not  
 all of them  
 actually trigger  
 the very sales resistance that you're  
 trying to avoid and then what happens  
 your prospect emotionally as you know  
 shuts down  
 okay and when they shut down what do  
 they typically do at the end of that  
 first call second call however long your  
 sales process is whether you sell b to c  
 or b to b they say things like i need to  
 think it over  
 i need to get more quotes i need to keep  
 looking at other vendors and companies i  
 need to do more research this sounds  
 good but it's not a good time for me  
 call me back in a few months i'll get  
 back to you for interested i need to  
 talk with my spouse i need to talk with  
 the board my business partners i need to  
 talk with my uncle who's a financial  
 advisor i need to talk with my aunt who  
 lives in a van down by the river right  
 you're always going to get those  
 objections because you couldn't get the  
 prospect to open up and tell you the  
 truth of what's really going on i'm not  
 saying the surface of what's going on  
 i'm saying below the surface of what's  
 going on if we can't learn how to do  
 that we're going to get all those  
 objections consistently and we're going  
 to lose sales that our clients who are  
 in the same industry you're in are  
 selling left and right like easy right  
 and left-handed lay-ups if they're  
 right-handed all right so let's do this  
 now  
 when they do that what they do is they  
 commoditize you and then you try to  
 typically offer them some type of  
 discount which most of them still won't  
 go for that and then you end up losing  
 them okay so that is something you want  
 to avoid all right now  
 how do you get your prospects let's skip  
 a party i've actually made some notes  
 for you so how to get your prospects to  
 expand  
 their answers for them to bring out more  
 pain and emotion how do you get them to  
 relive the pain  
 and how do you do that those are called  
 expanded any pq probing questions make  
 sure you write that down expanded any pq  
 probing questions and then after you ask  
 expanded probing questions you then have  
 to clarify their answers and then probe  
 even deeper so i'm going to give you  
 some various examples of how to do that  
 all right  
 so this is the first one right this is a  
 very easy one everybody should know this  
 i'm going to start giving you some easy  
 ones first and i'm going to give you  
 some more ninja nepq expanded probing  
 questions after that so the first one is  
 let's say the prospect tells you  
 something maybe a problem they have and  
 you would simply say  
 hold on tell me tell me more about that  
 when you said blank can you tell me more  
 about that see that's an easy one that's  
 a basic everybody should already know  
 that good lord that's been around for 50  
 years right it's just a powerful way to  
 get your prospect to expand their  
 problems that they bring up from your  
 questions now here's another one okay  
 let's say that you're trying to find out  
 the company's decision-making process  
 most sales people say well well besides  
 you who would be involved in this  
 decision and most people shut down  
 because pretty much every sales person  
 asking that same question once again you  
 don't want to sound like everybody else  
 that's tried to sell them for the last  
 10 15 20 years because they just think  
 you like everybody else all right so you  
 want to re-language it so this is called  
 an npq lead-in phrase can you walk me  
 through so write that down  
 sally can you walk me through your  
 company's decision-making process when  
 it comes to solving challenges like this  
 can you walk me through your company's  
 decision-making process when it comes to  
 solving problems like this all right  
 jayden johnson coaching of girls funded  
 my second so that's solid and funny  
 there you go justin i saw you comment  
 the other day all right so let's go to  
 the next one those are pretty basic i  
 just gave you some basic ones right  
 there right can you walk me through so  
 even if the prospect says in the meeting  
 that they are the only decision maker  
 you obviously never take that at face  
 value if you sell b2b i can assure you  
 that because there are other typically  
 there are always other influencers  
 they're going to influence that decision  
 even if they can't make the decision all  
 right so it sounds way better than  
 saying are you the only decision maker  
 all right you want to be able to  
 navigate through the organization if you  
 sell b2b now you wouldn't ask that  
 question you sold b2c would make any  
 sense in the four industries i sold in  
 my 17-year career two of them were b to  
 c two of them were b to b okay you don't  
 use that question for b to b all right  
 now let me give you another example here  
 all right  
 so they say something like some type of  
 issue or problem you want to them to  
 expand that so this is another nepq  
 lead-in phrase can you can you give me a  
 specific example  
 can you give me a specific example so i  
 understand that better  
 oh the company that was here they didn't  
 ship the xyz widgets for six weeks okay  
 hold on  
 walk me back can you give me a specific  
 example so i understand that better well  
 yeah you know three weeks ago see i'm  
 helping him relive the pain now that's  
 not the only thing we do that's the tip  
 of the iceberg asking that expanded  
 probing question after we do that we're  
 then going to clarify off more of the  
 pain they say and then we're going to  
 probe again i'm going to show you that  
 example in a minute all right we're just  
 getting warmed up all right here's  
 another one all right because pain is  
 good for you and them because what does  
 it do the pain the more pain you can  
 help them feel  
 the more urgency they have to want to  
 move away from that pain and actually  
 solve that pain and get what they want  
 all right now here's another one  
 okay here's an ndpq lead in phrase  
 okay can you can you go over with me can  
 you go over with me  
 what you might be looking for when  
 considering a company just so i  
 understand okay can you can you go over  
 me or can you walk me through those are  
 different ways you can ask that can you  
 go over with me what you might be  
 looking for  
 when choosing a company to work with  
 can you go over me with me all right now  
 let's talk about why we want to ask that  
 okay that's more of a b2b question you  
 wouldn't use that for b to b b to c it's  
 a leading phrase helps your prospect  
 uncover more in their mind of what they  
 truly want and it also helps position  
 your offer much more clear in their  
 minds once you get to the presentation  
 stage of the sales process with them all  
 right now as we go i'm gonna get this  
 even better for you i'm just giving you  
 a little warm up the more people that  
 stay here at the end i'm just gonna give  
 you more details at the end all right  
 all right here's another lead in phrase  
 walk me through okay write that down  
 write that down  
 i'm gonna go fast now walk me through  
 walk me through is a phrase that allows  
 your prospect to step by step explain  
 how the organization makes decisions and  
 allows you to know how to best position  
 your company within that process and who  
 to influence to win that account that  
 question you'd only use for b2b all  
 right now or you can say walk me through  
 what that means see if they say well we  
 had x y z problem happen hold on walk me  
 through what that means when you say  
 blank  
 can you walk me through what that means  
 that's a clarifying question right there  
 hold on when you say blank and you  
 repeat back the problem or issue they  
 had can you walk me through what that  
 means okay can you walk me through the  
 criteria used to make a decision on  
 something like this see how that works  
 can you walk me through all right now  
 here's another one  
 this is a really good one describe for  
 me okay  
 that's another nepq lead-in phrase  
 sally can you describe for me what you  
 possibly might be looking for to see if  
 we could help can you describe for me  
 what you're what you're possibly looking  
 for to see if we could help  
 can you describe for me what you meant  
 by that hold on john when you said blank  
 can you describe for me what you meant  
 by that see that's an ndpq clarifying  
 question okay and once again based off  
 their answer we're going to clarify more  
 and probe more which i'm going to give  
 you some examples here in a second all  
 right let me get oh i'm just warming up  
 here got some more here that i'm going  
 to give you these are actually really  
 good all right  
 okay here are a few more lead-in phrases  
 can you unwrap that for me make sure you  
 write that down  
 can you unpack that for me  
 can you go back a few pages for me  
 okay so let me explain that  
 sally can you unwrap that for me so i  
 have a better understanding  
 john can you john hold on john you're  
 losing me here unpack that for me a bit  
 more  
 okay john i'm not  
 just if you could walk back here maybe  
 go back a few pages for me so i can  
 understand what you meant by that can  
 you go back a few pages for me so i have  
 a better background on when you said  
 blank  
 see what you mean okay justin wells do  
 you use both b2b and b2c questions and  
 selling to small businesses coaches  
 well for small businesses you could use  
 some b2b  
 i mean if they're just a solopreneur  
 it's this it's just them probably not if  
 you're more b2b with companies that are  
 more like small cap mid cap large cap or  
 maybe  
 businesses that have at least a couple  
 business owners you'd use several the  
 b2b questions for sure okay b to c if  
 you're just selling to like a coach i  
 guess that's your industry you're more b  
 b to c there's a little bit of a  
 difference there for sure all right  
 let's keep going  
 can you walk go back a few pages unpack  
 that for me can you unwrap that for me  
 oh i'm just being nice to you i'm giving  
 you way more than i even told you i  
 would okay now  
 here's another nepq lead-in phrase can  
 you explain to me  
 okay can you can you explain to me in  
 more detail just so i have a better  
 understanding explain to me as another  
 any pq lead-in phrase that allows your  
 prospect to elaborate more on the  
 problem they just mentioned to you and  
 helps them feel more of the pain of that  
 problem the root cause how it's  
 impacting on them then after they expand  
 on their pain you're going to ask the  
 following nepq probing questions to help  
 them fill it even more did you have  
 something they're saying something about  
 spin  
 what do you mean by spin they're saying  
 spin is outdated they're saying it's a  
 sales technique well this is definitely  
 not spend selling i've taken 165 courses  
 i can assure you this is not spin  
 selling if you really take spin selling  
 you wouldn't have these lead-in phrases  
 because it doesn't come from spin  
 selling period  
 i mean i've read every book that they  
 have i've taken like five of their  
 courses they don't even talk about this  
 these people that are saying that  
 probably read like half a book and they  
 think it's something similar it's not  
 consultative selling if we were  
 practicing consultative selling i would  
 have made like 10 percent of the income  
 i made in my 17-year sales career i can  
 assure you that whoever said that  
 oh i love that i love the critics over  
 there they're so smart making millions  
 of dollars in commissions every year  
 what would i know what would i know all  
 right so after they say that so i'm  
 going to give you different examples all  
 right so after they ex after they after  
 they say oh well this happened and this  
 happened okay you're then going to ask  
 them these type of probing questions  
 hold on wait wait a minute when you said  
 blank how long has that been going on so  
 when they tell you like oh it's been  
 this problem and it's caused us to feel  
 this way and like oh my gosh and blah  
 blah okay and how long has that been  
 going on for that's an nepq  
 probing question how long is that hold  
 on how long has that been going for now  
 are you paying attention to my tonality  
 you don't say how long has that been  
 going on for george tonality is  
 important okay my background's human  
 behavior i might understand a little bit  
 about this stuff all right does anybody  
 did anybody major in human behavior on  
 here  
 anybody  
 i don't see any hands anybody major in  
 human behavior okay i'm not i'm not  
 understand all right so  
 hold on how long has that been going on  
 for see my tonality my my feature like  
 my body language even if i'm on the  
 phone i'm still saying the same thing oh  
 and how  
 how long has that been going on for like  
 i'm acting confused oh geez that's been  
 going on for probably 18 months okay so  
 help me understand you you've been  
 having the same problem for the last 18  
 months has that  
 has that had a  
 impact on you  
 what did i just do there did you hear my  
 tone did you see how my body moved in to  
 show  
 empathy  
 these are things we have to learn if you  
 want to make hundreds of thousands of  
 dollars a year in commissions if not  
 more  
 oh okay so you've been having this  
 problem repeat the problem back whatever  
 it is okay for the last 18 months has  
 that  
 has that had a  
 impact on you okay now if you're talking  
 to a business  
 has that had a  
 impact on the business has that had a  
 impact on you notice you slowed down  
 your tone if you said so you've been  
 having this problem for the last 18  
 months george has that had an impact on  
 you no not really  
 it's all how you ask the question okay i  
 can ask it two different ways and i'm  
 gonna get a two different types of  
 reaction okay you can't sound like a  
 scripted robot very important all right  
 now the prospect a lot of times will say  
 this when when you ask that i'm going to  
 go to the next one here  
 okay they'll be like oh you have no idea  
 well in what way though  
 see how i'm probing deeper this is the  
 part here that most sales people miss  
 they don't know how to they'll ask one  
 probing question they'll answer it and  
 they're like okay and then they're like  
 okay what's next on my script ask oh  
 well george let me ask you this and they  
 get the prospect to say surface up  
 they're not building enough urgency or  
 gap because they don't know where to  
 probe okay i'm just giving you a little  
 tip of the iceberg i'm giving you a  
 little golden i'm getting a little hors  
 d'oeuvre today a little nibble compared  
 to what our clients go through in our  
 virtual training courses and group  
 trainings all right well hold on in what  
 way though oh well in this way and that  
 way see i'm helping him relive the pain  
 even more all right all right let's keep  
 going  
 got a few more things i'm going to give  
 to just being mr nice guy over here  
 today  
 we have one human psychology and  
 psychophysiology person i love that  
 person that's a good person okay start  
 to understand that mixed in with really  
 good sales skills that work with human  
 behavior you can make hundreds of  
 thousands of dollars a year if not more  
 once you learn any pq all right so let's  
 go over the expanded probing questions  
 the lead in phrases i want you to write  
 these down very quickly  
 walk me through  
 i'm not practicing tonality here walk me  
 through what you mean by that  
 tell me more  
 about whatever that is tell me more hold  
 on tell me more about that can you give  
 me an example okay can you share with me  
 can you share with me  
 describe for me now you could also say  
 can you describe for me can you share  
 with me hold on tell me more when you  
 said okay now you don't want to say can  
 you can you can use 17 times because  
 that's going to sound like a technique  
 you have to mix that up all right  
 hold on unwrap that for me  
 you're losing me  
 unwrap that for me so i have a better  
 understanding  
 okay i'm not understanding can you  
 unwrap that for me a little bit so i  
 have a better background john i  
 i i'm not understanding what you meant  
 can you unwrap that for me so i have a  
 better background on what you meant  
 unwrap that for me did you write that  
 down all right let me give you some more  
 unpack that for me so instead of unwrap  
 you're unpacking  
 oh sally um  
 can you  
 unpack that for me a bit so i understand  
 more okay  
 explain to me so i know how that affects  
 you can you explain that to me a bit  
 more so i know how that affects you when  
 that happens okay  
 can you go back a few pages for me  
 john whoa whoa whoa you're losing me  
 you're on page 15  
 i'm still back on page three can you go  
 back a few pages for me  
 never heard that one have you okay can  
 you go back a few pages from me when you  
 said okay see how that works all right  
 i'm being mr nice guy today all right  
 let's keep going now these questions i'm  
 going to show you a few more  
 these questions show your prospects that  
 you are what that you are there for them  
 that you want to hear their pain you not  
 only want to hear their pain but you  
 want them to do what hear their pain  
 because you want them to relive the  
 experience of what the pain has done to  
 them because they don't have the problem  
 resolved yet now what is the most  
 intense human emotion  
 it's pain  
 without pain without the gap from where  
 they are compared to where they want to  
 be you cannot tell them what their  
 problems are you cannot tell them what  
 the gap is because if you do you're  
 biased you're the salesperson it's going  
 to go in one ear out the other you have  
 to ask the right questions that get them  
 to expand the pain and tell the pain to  
 themselves  
 because if they tell themselves what's  
 true and their pain  
 is that more persuasive than you telling  
 them their problem  
 i think you know the answer i would hope  
 you know the answer by now okay now  
 unless you  
 so let me clarify this  
 without pulling out their pain from the  
 prospect with any pq questions your  
 prospects will keep living that pain  
 doing what they've always done staying  
 in the status quo  
 never solving their problem that's up to  
 you as the sales person learn those  
 skills so you allow them to overcome  
 their own fears  
 their own issues in their mind that's  
 holding them back from solving these  
 problems and getting them where they  
 want to go and that's in any industry we  
 train 158 industries according to forbes  
 says forbes magazine said there's 158  
 industries they just came out that now  
 there's subsets of each industry we  
 train in all of them so it doesn't  
 matter what industry you're in okay it's  
 all the same as long as you're selling  
 to a human being that has problems and  
 or emotional needs and your solution  
 solves those okay now i'm going to give  
 you a few more examples of what are  
 called napq clarifying and probing  
 questions that need to be asked after  
 the lead in phrases in the expanded  
 probing questions if you want to sell  
 even more these are very important to  
 get your prospect to go under the  
 surface with their answers and tell you  
 what's really going on okay because the  
 questions help you clarify what your  
 prospect is saying but more importantly  
 it triggers your prospect to clarify  
 their real problems and where they want  
 to go okay now they also help you probe  
 deeper to pull out their emotions you're  
 getting them into their emotional state  
 tony robbins talks a lot about that tony  
 understands human behavior if we can't  
 get them to their emotional state  
 it's very hard for them to change their  
 situation okay  
 also you know i did a keynote here a  
 week ago for a large insurance company  
 they had about 6 000 agents just there  
 in that room i think they have about 12  
 or 13 000 agents and in that keynote i  
 said look all selling is is change  
 that's all selling is it's about change  
 one thing only okay so whether the  
 prospect wants something new or they're  
 moving away from pain it's all about  
 change here's your problem though human  
 beings don't like change  
 so all sales is change  
 yet human beings don't like change even  
 though we say we do  
 that's what you're going up against so  
 if you can't get them into their  
 emotional state  
 they don't want to change they have too  
 much fear and that's why you get so many  
 objections at the end i want to think it  
 over now is not a good time i need to  
 keep looking around i need more quotes i  
 need more proposals i need to do more  
 research that's exactly why because you  
 don't understand how to get them to  
 their emotional state okay how to  
 clarify and probe and take them through  
 that sales process with an apq now  
 here's some few clarifying questions  
 joey that was awesome yeah there you go  
 oh joey you were at the keynote well  
 there you go you must be a member of  
 quality hold on what do you mean by that  
 exactly see that's just a basic  
 clarifying question but very powerful 99  
 of sales people can't even ask that hold  
 on what do you mean john when you say  
 blank what did you mean by that exactly  
 now let's say they give you some type of  
 emotional word okay they're like i'm so  
 frustrated i'm so annoyed when that  
 happens oh my gosh it causes so much  
 stress you can say hold on what do you  
 mean by stress or hold on what do you  
 mean by annoyed or you can simply just  
 repeat back the emotional word i want  
 you to try this when your spouse says oh  
 i'm so stressed stressed  
 oh you have no idea and they're going to  
 go off i'm seriously any type of emotion  
 world frustrated stressed concerned uh  
 annoyed stressed any of those words  
 there's a lot more emotional words any  
 time so a prospect says an emotional  
 word i want you to repeat back that one  
 word stressed  
 annoyed  
 frustrated  
 concerned  
 okay and watch other oh my gosh i have  
 so much concern  
 very powerful okay probing statement all  
 right hold on when you say stress  
 how do you mean exactly just another way  
 to do it or what did you mean by you  
 feel frustrated hold on what did you  
 mean by annoyed see it's just other ways  
 to do that all right how long has that  
 been going on for see we're right back  
 to that oh  
 hold that stress oh the stress is blah  
 blah blah blah oh how how long is that  
 going on how long has it been going on  
 so that's been so you've had the stress  
 the last three months has that  
 has that had a  
 impact on you see i'm leaning in i'm  
 verbal pausing if i'm like so you've had  
 the stress for three months john has  
 that had an impact on you  
 uh yeah it's not that bad  
 okay hold on you so you've been having  
 this stress the last three months has  
 that  
 has that had a  
 impact on you oh my see different it  
 forces them to think deeper by my verbal  
 pausing ability all right so here's some  
 more clarified questions hold on what's  
 causing that issue can you walk hold on  
 when you say blank what's cause an issue  
 what's causing this to happen okay  
 what's prompting you to look into  
 changing this now though okay but what's  
 prompting you to look at changing this  
 now rather than pushing it down the road  
 like unsuccessful people would  
 nobody wants to be unsuccessful depends  
 on what you sell that that question you  
 only use in certain industries can i ask  
 what originally led you to this decision  
 in the first place can i ask whoa whoa i  
 lost my pin  
 can i ask what originally led you to  
 that decision in the first place okay  
 but why is it important for you to look  
 at changing this now rather than pushing  
 it down the road well jeremy the reason  
 why we need to do it now is because of  
 blah blah blah see how we do that all  
 right  
 folks hopefully i gave you enough i said  
 i was going to give you seven expanded  
 probing questions how many did we give  
 them  
 i think i gave like 12 different  
 expanded probing questions lead in  
 phrases nepq leading phrases probing  
 questions clarifying questions and that  
 is just like the tip of the iceberg i  
 just gave you little little nibbles like  
 little fish like the little goldfish you

\# Never Send A Proposal Without Doing This FIRST  
\# https://www.youtube.com/watch/F0KCQ6XfNIQ

 so Rick Lane asked earlier today when we  
 posted I keep getting we are getting  
 other bids it seems like I'm always the  
 first one in the door and waste a lot of  
 time and energy building options and  
 proposals only to have them go with the  
 competitor then they never answer me  
 when I ask why they chose to go to the  
 competitor okay  
 Rick let me help you brother let me help  
 you brother from another mother the  
 reason why  
 you're when you say I I waste a lot of  
 energy building options and proposals  
 okay first of all go down to the bottom  
 of this video hit the Subscribe button  
 that's probably important for you hit  
 the Subscribe button and to the right of  
 that or maybe the left I don't know  
 somewhere in there there's like a little  
 bell that's your notifications button  
 hit the notifications Button as well so  
 you get notified by YouTube Every time I  
 post a new training video which I  
 typically do two to four times a week  
 people do not buy based on you having  
 cool options or proposals they buy  
 because of a gap you're able to help  
 them see and feel from where they are  
 compared to where they want to be okay  
 so you have to learn what are called  
 situ well first of all you have to learn  
 what are called connecting questions  
 that trigger the prospect to want to  
 open up and engage with you how do you  
 disarm the process aspect how do you get  
 them to let their guard down they're not  
 just going to let their guard down and  
 just open up to you and tell you all of  
 their problems and emotions if you don't  
 understand the right tonality and the  
 right question in the beginning that  
 triggers their brain to want to do that  
 that's what we train you in our virtual  
 training courses if you don't have those  
 you know message me directly right now  
 because like our clients who sell  
 exactly what you are they don't have the  
 problem that you have just so you're  
 aware they make those sales so what you  
 want to do is you want to be able to  
 build that Gap from where they are we  
 call that their current state okay those  
 are by situation questions that help you  
 and them find out what the real  
 situation is because most your prospects  
 don't really understand what their real  
 situation is when you first start  
 talking to them as you know okay then  
 you help them build a gap by the  
 questioning that you learn from us in  
 apq neuro emotional persuasion questions  
 and then we help them see what their  
 future is going to look like once all  
 these Newfound problems are solved their  
 object active State those are by  
 solution awareness questions now the Gap  
 is only determined  
 by your problem awareness questions  
 you're able to ask them and how you  
 clarify and probe off their answers that  
 build a massive sense of urgency in  
 internal tension in their body and mind  
 now internal internal  
 um I want to say internal tension is far  
 different than external pressure that's  
 not sales pressure sales pressure does  
 not work it triggers more resistance  
 more objections you lose more deals if  
 you do that okay it's your trigging  
 internal pressure where they feel in  
 their mind and their brain it is far  
 less risky for them  
 to purchase what you're offering and  
 solve their problems and get where they  
 want than it is for them to do nothing  
 at all stay in the status quo the  
 problems stay the same or go with a  
 competitor so with that type of question  
 it tells me that what you're doing is  
 you're not building a gap in their brain  
 from where they are compared to where  
 they want to be you can't do that by  
 telling them that that just goes in one  
 ear at the other and so all you're doing  
 is you're asking maybe a few questions  
 then putting together a bunch of options  
 and proposals and email them to it and  
 hoping and praying that somehow they're  
 just going to like it over all of the  
 other bids and that's a very dangerous  
 way to sell because what happens by  
 doing that is you and you probably don't  
 it's not your fault look you were TR you  
 were forced to probably sell the way you  
 are because somebody trained you how to  
 do that so I don't it's not your fault  
 you just don't know what you don't know  
 sometimes so what happens  
 with that way of selling you've been  
 taught is it triggers your prospect to  
 think cost or price-based thinking over  
 results-based thinking now in our  
 virtual training platforms and our group  
 training if you're one of our clients  
 you learn the right question that allows  
 them to get start thinking results-based  
 thinking so don't think about cost or  
 price they think about the end result  
 okay and when they think about the end  
 result they're always going to go with  
 you because your competitors wouldn't  
 know how to even ask those questions to  
 get them to think that way whereas right  
 now they're probably going to their  
 competitors because they're they're  
 under bidding you or they're they're  
 getting it for a lower price now one  
 question sorry about eating I've got  
 something on my mustache here one thing  
 that you can't you can't ask them and  
 let's say that you know they're meeting  
 with some you know some competitors or  
 competition you can say now that they're  
 like well we just want to get some more  
 bids and kind of look around and you  
 don't know how to resolve that I'm just  
 going to kind of throw you a bone here  
 instead of like showing you that that  
 probably was triggered by what you  
 didn't ask in the beginning that  
 triggered them to keep wanting to look  
 around but if they say yeah I'm going to  
 look at some other bids yeah what were  
 you hoping those bids would say though  
 well we just want to know about the  
 price and blah blah blah blah okay so  
 let's say that you look at all these  
 other bids and you have all these  
 companies come in and let's say that  
 they all including us are able to solve  
 this issue and they're all able to do x  
 y z and the prices are very similar at  
 that point  
 who would you decide how would you  
 decide who to go with  
 and they're going to say well at that  
 point we would really go with the  
 company that did this or could do this  
 for us and that's their hot button that  
 you need to focus on okay now if I had  
 you out here on the live and pulled you  
 up on screen I'd ask you more kind of  
 questions to get behind the context of  
 where you're coming from but hopefully  
 that helps and look if you if you want

\# How HUMOR Eliminates FEAR  
\# https://www.youtube.com/watch/H1GICQr5x4k

 now let's go to the second objection  
 how do you respond when the prospect  
 says uh  
 i don't know  
 um  
 i don't know barry this it just it just  
 sounds too good to be true  
 or let's say you're in a discovery call  
 or you're going through the presentation  
 they just stop you i mean this all  
 sounds great but it just it just  
 i just get this gut feeling that it  
 sounds too good to be true  
 how many of you have ever got that  
 objection and lost a sale because of  
 that i don't want you to have to lose  
 sales when if you have the right  
 training  
 you would make those sales like our  
 clients make  
 so how many of you have ever lost a sale  
 to  
 it just sounds too good to be true how  
 many of you i know a lot of you have all  
 right here's how you overcome that  
 okay  
 for for one thing we have to realize  
 that this is just a fear-based objection  
 this is you can get this objection in  
 both b to c sales and b to b sales i was  
 in four industries in my 17 year sales  
 career two b to c two b to b i got this  
 objection in all four okay but it's  
 really easy to overcome okay so it's a  
 fear-based objection okay that you see  
 in a lot of industries especially if you  
 sell  
 some type of product or service or  
 training program that teaches people how  
 to get money now you're not necessarily  
 going to get this concern if you sell  
 life insurance you're not really going  
 to see it that much there or if you sell  
 cars  
 you might you're going to see this  
 objection more like the coaching  
 industry or the high ticket industry or  
 the make money biz up industry or  
 fulfillment industry or recruiting  
 industry maybe your job recruiter you're  
 going to hear this a lot okay so there  
 are certain industries i've even you  
 know we even train a a big large company  
 that sells cyber security to banks and  
 this is one of the top 10 objections  
 they get it sounds too good to be true  
 by ceos of banks okay so you're going to  
 get it in different objections some  
 industries you just won't get this  
 concerned let me roleplay it with you  
 prosecute says well it just it just  
 sounds too good to be true jeremy  
 well would you  
 like it  
 us to make it harder for you  
 so the first thing out of your mouth if  
 somebody says it sounds too good to be  
 true you just laughed with them and said  
 well  
 would you like us to make it harder for  
 you and you joke with them i'm telling  
 you it is a massive pattern interrupt  
 that causes most people to laugh and the  
 concern is over right there now  
 i'm going to show you how to keep going  
 because i want to make sure the concern  
 is buttoned up but the first thing you  
 do is a pattern interrupt one of most  
 salespeople they argue with them and  
 then they lose a sale so they say this  
 sounds too good to be true i might say  
 how do you mean it sounds too good to be  
 true  
 that i could either ask that clarifying  
 question or i could say  
 well  
 would you like for us to make it harder  
 for you and they go like oh i don't want  
 it to make harder but you know what i  
 mean  
 and then they're going to say something  
 like oh don't get me wrong but when i  
 was a kid my you know my grandpa would  
 always say  
 look john johnny boy or sally if it  
 sounds too good to be true it probably  
 is  
 let's say the prospect says that so you  
 would simply ask  
 well um  
 can i make a suggestion amy sure yeah go  
 ahead  
 that's saying if it sounds too good to  
 be true it probably is where do you  
 think that came from do you think that  
 came from someone that was extremely  
 wealthy  
 or someone that was poor  
 let me ask that question again so that's  
 saying if it sounds too good to be true  
 it probably is do you think where do you  
 think that came from did it do you think  
 it came from somebody that's extremely  
 wealthy  
 or somebody that was poor  
 lower your voice  
 now 99 percent of people can say oh some  
 of that was poor if they say i don't  
 know well if you really thought about it  
 who do you think it came from oh okay  
 somebody that was poor okay  
 exactly you say exactly someone that was  
 poor  
 so if we start taking financial advice  
 from people who are poor  
 what type of financial results do you  
 think we're going to get in our lives  
 see how i ask that question  
 did you see my tone  
 okay you want to learn that tone we can  
 teach you that tone our clients have  
 learned that tone in our virtual  
 training courses that's why they're  
 selling what you are now but they make  
 probably triple what you do  
 they just learned how to do it you can  
 learn how to do that as well okay so can  
 i make a suggestion sure go ahead jeremy  
 that saying if it sounds too good to be  
 true it probably is where do you think  
 that came from do you think that came  
 from someone that was extremely wealthy  
 or somebody that was  
 poor  
 oh somebody was well exactly somebody  
 who's poor so if we take  
 financial advice  
 from people who are poor  
 what type of financial results do you  
 think we're going to get in our lives  
 and the prospects always will say well  
 i guess the same results they're getting  
 and then you're going to ask well do you  
 do you want to change that  
 look how i leaned in look at my empathy  
 my tone well do you  
 do you want to change that yeah i want  
 to change that and then you're going to  
 say this  
 this is an npq negative reverse  
 well  
 i mean you don't have to change it i  
 mean tell me this like why why look at  
 doing this now like why not push it down  
 the road like  
 unsuccessful people would  
 let me repeat that well you don't have  
 to change well no no i need to change  
 okay but for you  
 i mean why why look at doing this now  
 like why not just push it down the road  
 like  
 unsuccessful people would  
 and you know what they're going to do  
 they're going to push back and they're  
 going to say oh no no i'm not going to  
 be like that and then you're simply  
 going to say okay so time to make a  
 change possibly  
 that is a nabq probing statement all  
 taught in the virtual training courses  
 in our group training by me and our  
 sales trainers okay and then you're  
 going to ask about two to three  
 commitment questions which we teach you  
 those in the virtual training courses  
 and the group coaching and then that  
 person is ready to go  
 you
