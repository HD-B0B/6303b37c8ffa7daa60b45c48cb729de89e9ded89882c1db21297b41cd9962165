---
## **Introduction**

### **Welcome & Importance of Value Propositions**
- **Opening Statement:**

## **Step 1: Define the Problem/Opportunity**

### **Why Definition Matters**
- **Key Insight:**  
  "Ideas are abundant, but they're meaningless until they address a specific problem or opportunity. That's why defining the 'who' and 'what' is so vital."

### **Framework: The Four 'S'**
1. **Unworkable**
2. **Unavoidable**
3. **Urgent**
4. **Underserved**

### **Interactive Session: Defining 'Who'**
- **Example:**  
  "Letâ€™s hear from **Gulnaz** from ConnectEd. Can you share who your value proposition is for?"

- **Gulnaz's Response:**  
  "Children in marginalized communities and rural areas in Kazakhstan who lack basic digital literacy skills and equipment."

- **Discussion:**  
  - **Key Takeaway:**  
    "Specificity is crucial. Saying 'everybody in Kazakhstan' is too broad and can lead to failure. Focus on a clear, defined segment."

### **Common Pitfall Example:**
- **Case Study:**  
  "Compr Fasial stated their product helps people dissatisfied with current credit products. However, they didn't specify **who** their target audience is. Without knowing the 'who,' it's challenging to identify the persona and target effectively."

### **User vs. Customer:**
- **Question from the Audience:**  
  "If your user is different from your customer, who do you put on the 'for who'?"

- **Discussion:**  
  "You need to satisfy both the user and the customer. The user must find value, and the customer must see a compelling reason to invest."

---
## **Framework Deep Dive: The Four 'S'**

### **1. Unworkable**
- **Definition:**  
  "A problem is unworkable if its consequences are so severe that it demands immediate attention."

- **Example:**  
  "When the first iPhones were released, activation issues made them nearly unusable, leading to widespread dissatisfaction."

- **Interactive Prompt:**  
  "Think of an unworkable problem in your industry. Share it with your group."

### **2. Unavoidable**
- **Definition:**  
  "Problems or needs that are inevitable, like taxes and aging."

- **Example:**  
  "Aging is unavoidable, and industries like healthcare and financial services thrive by addressing related needs."

- **Audience Interaction:**  
  "Space Health presented the need for medical professionals in the commercial space sector. Is this urgent? How?"

### **3. Urgent**
- **Definition:**  
  "Needs that are high priority and demand immediate action."

- **Example:**  
  "The shift to mobile phones created an urgent need for mobile banking solutions."

- **Interactive Session:**  
  "Space Health explained the urgency in providing medical services for space tourism. Does this resonate with your target segment?"

### **4. Underserved**
- **Definition:**  
  "When the current solutions do not adequately meet the needs of the target audience."

- **Example:**  
  "Taste of Kenya identified that low-income consumers couldn't afford local coffee, pushing them to cheaper, non-local alternatives."

- **Group Activity:**  
  "Define what is underserved in your market. Present your findings."

---
## **Step 2: Evaluate the Value Proposition**

### **Framework: 3D Evaluation**
1. **Disruptive**
2. **Discontinuous**
3. **Defensible**

### **1. Disruptive**
- **Definition:**  
  "Introducing a new business model or technology that changes the existing market landscape."

- **Example:**  
  "Airbnb disrupted the travel industry by creating a platform for resource sharing without owning properties."

### **2. Discontinuous**
- **Definition:**  
  "Innovations that create entirely new possibilities, often enabled by technological advancements."

- **Example:**  
  "The iPad became critical in fields like medicine and aviation by enabling new applications."

### **3. Defensible**
- **Definition:**  
  "Building barriers that protect your value proposition from competitors."

- **Strategies:**  
  - **Intellectual Property (IP)**
  - **Network Effects**
  - **Switching Costs**

- **Interactive Example:**  
  "Dan from Terf Flow discussed how their software provides unique, interpretable reports that are defensible through IP and switching costs."

### **Group Discussion: Applying 3D Framework**
- **Activity:**  
  "Take your value proposition and identify how it is disruptive, discontinuous, and defensible."

- **Feedback:**  
  "Examples from the room demonstrated strong 3D elements, setting them up for success."

---
## **Step 3: Build the Value Proposition**

### **Framework: Gain-Pain Ratio**
- **Definition:**  
  "Measure the benefits (gain) your product delivers against the challenges (pain) of adopting it."

- **Example:**  
  "Venmo offers the gain of easy money transfers but initially faced pains like security concerns and network limitations."

### **Interactive Prompt: Assessing Gain-Pain**
- **Exercise:**  
  "Map out the gains your product provides and the pains your customers might face in adopting it."

- **Discussion:**  
  "Aim for a high gain-to-pain ratio (e.g., 10:1) to encourage adoption despite any initial challenges."

### **Tips for Maximizing Gain-Pain Ratio:**
1. **Enhance Gains:**  
   "Clearly articulate the benefits and quantify them (e.g., 30-90% cost savings)."

2. **Minimize Pains:**  
   "Address adoption barriers like training, integration, and switching costs upfront."

3. **Continuous Feedback:**  
   "Engage with users to refine both gains and pains continually."

   - **Metrics:**  
     "High, Medium, Low or numerical ratings."

4. **Analyze and Identify Unique Differentiators:**
   - **Focus Areas:**  
     "Determine where your product outperforms competitors and offers unique delighters."

### **Interactive Example: Instagram's Value Proposition Grid**
- **Must-Haves:**
  - **Competitor A:** High
  - **Competitor B:** High
  - **Instagram:** High

- **Performance Benefits:**
  - **Competitor A:** Medium
  - **Competitor B:** Medium
