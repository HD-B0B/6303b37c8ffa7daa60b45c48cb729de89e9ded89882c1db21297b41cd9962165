Maintaining a clean email list is crucial for ensuring high deliverability and engagement rates. Here's how to categorize and handle your email list effectively:

- **Good Emails**: Valid and active email addresses.

- **Automatic Removal**: Tools like **Snov.io** will automatically remove emails that frequently bounce.

## 2. Crafting Your Email Copy

Writing compelling cold email copy is essential for garnering responses from prospects who have no prior knowledge of your business.

### **The Challenges:**

- **Lack of Credibility**: Recipients don't know who you are. 
- **Relevance**: Your offer might not align with their current needs.
- **Competition**: The market might be saturated with similar offers.

### **Goals of Your Cold Email Copy**

#### **Goal #1: Get Them to Open Your Email**

- **Subject Line and First Line Matter**: Spark curiosity without giving away too much.
- **Use Short Questions**: Examples like "Got ads?" or "These your ads?" can be effective.  
- **Reinforce Subject Line**: The first sentence should complement the subject.

#### **Goal #2: Get Them to Reply**

- **Keep It Short**: Limit to six sentences.
- **Avoid Links or Images**: Prevent emails from being marked as spam.
- **Spam Detection**: Use tools like [Mailmeteor.com Spam Checker](https://mailmeteor.com/spam-checker) to avoid trigger words.
- **Compliance**: Include a mailing address and an unsubscribe link as per CAN-SPAM laws.
- **Simple Call to Action**: Use open-ended questions to encourage replies.

### **Personalization Techniques**

Personalization is key to making your emails feel tailored and relevant.

**Best Practices:**

1. **Basic Personalization**:
   - Include the recipient's first name.
   - Example: "Hi [First Name],"

2. **Avoid Over-Personalization**:
   - Too many variables can lead to errors and reduce credibility.

3. **Ensure Data Accuracy**:
   - Double-check personalized data to maintain authenticity.

4. **Use Simple Personalization**:
   - Add value without being intrusive.

**Example:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed that [Company Name] is doing amazing work in [Industry]. I'd love to discuss how we can help you achieve even greater success.`

Best,
[Your Name]

### **Advanced Personalization: Leveraging Tools**

## **3\. Advanced Targeting Strategies**

Effective targeting ensures your cold emails reach the right decision-makers who are most likely to convert.

### **Basic Targeting with Snov.io**

When setting up your targeting filters in Snov.io, consider the following:

* **Job Titles**: Focus on broad decision-makers like CEOs, Owners, Founders, Presidents, COOs, and CMOs.  
* **Location**: Target specific regions where your services are most relevant (e.g., United States).  
* **Employee Counts**: Preferably 1-50 employees for higher response rates when targeting decision-makers.

### **Industry and Keywords**

* **Broad Targeting**: Select multiple B2B industries that could potentially benefit from your offer.  
* **Creative Targeting**: Explore industries beyond the obvious to find untapped opportunities.

### **Advanced Filters**

1. **Job Listings**: Target companies actively hiring for roles relevant to your services.  
   * **Example**: Instead of assuming which industries need PR, target companies hiring for publicist or communications roles.  
2. **Fundraising**: Focus on companies currently raising funds or in early funding stages.  
   * **Strategy**: Offer PR services tailored to their fundraising phase, enhancing their valuation through media exposure.  
3. **Growth Metrics**: Use data on company growth or downsizing to tailor your offers.  
   * **Example**: Offer services that help scaling companies or cost-saving solutions for those downsizing.  
4. **Interest-Based Targeting**: Identify what your leads are actively searching for to meet them at the right moment.  
   * **Example**: Target companies interested in public relations services based on their online searches.

### **Understanding Inverse Marketing Relationship**

* **High-Value Offers**: When targeting larger companies with lower response rates, ensure your offer is substantial enough to justify the effort.  
* **Metrics Adjustment**: Align your success metrics with the scale and value of your target audience.

**Key Takeaway:** Your success metrics should align with your target audience's size and your offer's value. For larger targets, a higher-value offer compensates for lower response rates.

   * Use AI to dynamically insert relevant content, such as recent news or specific challenges, into your email copy.  
   * Example: "Congratulations on your recent \[Achievement\]. I'd love to discuss how we can build on that success."

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

* **Using AI for Visual Elements**:  
  * Avoid using AI-generated images or videos as it can make your emails seem less genuine and hurt deliverability.  
* **Over-Personalization**:  
  * Too many personalized elements can lead to errors and reduce the credibility of your emails.  
* **Ignoring Human Oversight**:  
  * Always review AI-generated content to ensure it aligns with your brand voice and campaign goals.

### **Example of Effective AI Personalization:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed that [Company Name] recently launched [Product/Service]. Congratulations on this achievement! I'd love to discuss how our [Your Service/Product] can help you maximize its impact.

Best,
[Your Name]

**Why It Works:**

* **Specific Mention**: References a recent product/service launch, showing that the email is tailored to the lead.  
* **Clear Value Proposition**: Highlights how your offering can support their recent achievement.  
* **Personal Touch**: Maintains a human-friendly tone while leveraging AI-generated insights.

## **18\. The Secret Way to Get 100% Open Rates Using ChatGPT**

### **Cold Outreach Secret**

What if I told you there was a way to do cold outreach that had an almost 100% open rate? In this section, I'm going to share a cold outreach secret that everybody else seems to be sleeping on. When you combine AI with this secret outreach tool, I promise even Fortune 500 CEOs are not going to be able to ignore your message.

### **Why This Method Works**

Here's why the method I'm going to teach you actually works. There are three main things that affect whether or not someone is going to read your cold outreach:

1. **Volume**: How many messages a person gets on a given day on a specific platform. For example, as a marketing agency owner myself, I get hundreds of cold email messages every single week, and it can be difficult to get me to open and read one of these cold messages. The platform you're messaging me on matters a lot. If you send me a message on LinkedIn or email, then I'm probably not going to open it, but if you send me a message on Instagram, there's a good chance that you're going to get a response.  
2. **Personalization**: If someone believes that a message was intended for them and personalized to them, then it is our human nature to want to see what's inside and reply. The trickier thing is getting the recipient to actually believe that the message is personalized. This becomes even harder because of all the AI personalization tools that are out there and accessible, so we as online marketers need to get more creative. If you send me a cold email with a screenshot of my YouTube channel or a Loom video with my website in the background, you might think you're being sneaky with your AI tool, but most entrepreneurs can see right through it. In fact, this might even backfire and cause them to lose trust in you.  
   **Experiment**: Try sending 10 leads a truly personalized email after taking the time to research them and their business and then writing something unique by yourself. You'll probably get closer to a 50% reply rate.  
3. **Curiosity**: Human beings can't help but to satisfy their curiosity. There's a lot of different tactics to peak someone's curiosity, but these tactics only work if they're unique and original. If that lead sees that tactic used more than two or three times, it no longer works. Personalized letters can hurt your trust and credibility if they are not personalized.

### **Visualization**

Imagine this: We have open rate on the Y-axis and volume on the X-axis. Open rate increases as volume decreases—the less volume someone has to deal with when filtering through marketing messages, the better their open rate is going to be. Additionally, open rate increases as personalization increases. This might sound obvious, but it can be really hard to do and can be really expensive.

### **The Method**

How do you send a message through a channel that has low volume, where that person isn't bombarded every day with cold advertisements? How do you do it in such a way that feels hyper-personalized so that they can't help themselves but to respond, and how do you do it in a way that peaks their curiosity so that they have no choice but to open and read your message?

**Imagine** you're a successful business owner and you just finished clearing your inbox for the day, probably deleted 100 cold emails. Now, your office manager walks in and puts six envelopes on your desk. Four of them are from credit card companies trying to sell you new credit cards. One's an ad from Office Depot with a coupon attached, but the last envelope is a thick, heavy envelope with a real stamp on it. Somebody actually took the time to hand address it to you, wrote your name, wrote your address, and it's in their own handwriting in pen. Do you throw that envelope away with all the others, or do you open it?

### **Setting Up Automation**

The secret tool I'm about to share is called **Handwrytten.com**—spelled with a "y," not an "i." This tool integrates seamlessly with Zapier, allowing you to trigger a card to be written and sent automatically. Here's how it works:

1. **Create an Account**: Sign up for handwrytten.com and set up your templates.  
2. **Design the Back of the Card**: Just like a postcard, design the back side.  
3. **Automation Setup in Zapier**:  
   * **Trigger**: Use a webhook from Go HighLevel (GHL) after a lead fills out your course intake form.  
   * **Process**: Use ChatGPT to generate a personalized message based on the lead's information.  
   * **Address Validation**: Use **Lob.com** to validate US addresses before sending.  
   * **Send Card**: Automatically send the personalized handwrytten card via handwrytten.com.

### **Use Cases**

1. **Sending Cards to Hot Leads**: Personalized cards to leads you've spoken with on a sales call.  
2. **Reaching Out to High-Value Individuals**: Sending personalized letters to Fortune 500 CEOs with unique offers.  
3. **Nurturing Active Customers**: Sending thank-you cards to new customers or employees to strengthen relationships.

### **Automation Workflow Example**

1. **Trigger**: Lead fills out course intake form in GHL.
2. **Process**: ChatGPT generates personalized thank-you message.
3. **Validate Address**: Use Lob.com to ensure the address is deliverable.
4. **Send Card**: handwrytten.com sends the personalized card.
5. **Follow-Up**: Use delivery confirmation to trigger a follow-up email.

### **Example of a Personalized Letter:**

## **19\. Get 20% Replies with Cold Email Marketing**

### **Intro Summary**

There's a dirty secret that cold email experts are not telling you. If you're sick of seeing people's screenshots of their cold email campaigns getting 20%, 30%, 40% reply rates and you're wondering if it's fake and if it's real, how is it possible? In this section, I'm going to expose the only way to get 20% reply rates consistently and I'm going to walk you through step by step exactly how to do it. The next time you see someone posting their insane cold email results, you will know exactly how they're getting them.

### **The Only Way to Get 20% Replies**

I personally have built hundreds of email campaigns myself, many of which got at least 20% reply rates. I also own and operate the largest cold email community in the world with more than 10,000 cold email marketers from all over the globe. When I see somebody that's getting this type of results, I reach out and have a conversation with them about what they're doing. Although the answers vary quite a bit, the tactic that they're using to do it does not change at all.

### **The Tactic**

The power of cold email extends way beyond just getting clients. When most people stumble upon cold email, they first think of it as a marketing tactic—a way to generate leads that turn into clients that pay you money in your business. I still strongly believe cold email is the number one way to generate qualified leads for the lowest price, and there are hundreds of entrepreneurs making tens of thousands every single month inside of my program that can attest to this because it's true.

**But now imagine** that you have a cold email machine that's already printing money for you on autopilot. You've mastered cold email and now you're trying to expand your business with other forms of marketing. For example, say you want to hire influencers to promote your product, get booked on podcasts, find similar businesses to partner with so that you can cross-promote and refer each other's business. What do you think the best way to go about finding these opportunities is? Sure, you could hire an influencer agency or a podcast booking agency, or you could just set up another cold email campaign but with a very different purpose.

### **Using Cold Email for Different Purposes**

When you're doing B2B lead generation using cold email, you're typically almost always trying to sell something to a business owner. The reality is that people don't like getting sold to in their email; it's not supposed to be for that. This is why I recommend using very high-value lead magnets in your cold email campaigns. Even the best cold email campaign with the best lead magnet and the best personalization almost never breaks that 10% reply rate. The reason is that the business owner isn't stupid—they know they're being sold to and people don't like being sold to in the email.

**The Secret** that most people will not tell you is that those screenshots of cold email campaigns with 30% reply rates are almost always from campaigns with a very different purpose, and that purpose is not sales-related.

### **Ways to Use Cold Email for Higher Reply Rates**

1. **Finding Influencers to Work With**:  
   * Scrape Instagram using tools like **Lead Sniper**.  
   * Filter leads by their number of followers and specific keywords in their bio.  
   * Send cold emails with an offer to pay them to promote your product/service.  
   * **Expected Reply Rate**: 30-40%  
2. **Hosting a Podcast**:  
   * Use cold email to book guests for your podcast.  
   * Scrape websites like **PodcastGuest.com** to find leads interested in being interviewed.  
   * Send cold emails inviting them to be a guest on your show.  
   * **Expected Reply Rate**: 40%  
3. **Finding New Business Partnerships**:  
   * Partner with companies in parallel industries.  
   * Example: A PR firm partnering with ghostwriting and publishing companies, podcasters, and social media companies.  
   * **Expected Reply Rate**: 10% (with strong social proof)

### **Building the Campaign**

**Finding the Right Leads:**

* Use **Snov.io** to create a new filter search.  
* Example: Lead generation software companies.  
* Target job titles like CMOs, Marketing Directors, Founders, Owners.

* Export leads and verify emails with **MillionVerifier**.
