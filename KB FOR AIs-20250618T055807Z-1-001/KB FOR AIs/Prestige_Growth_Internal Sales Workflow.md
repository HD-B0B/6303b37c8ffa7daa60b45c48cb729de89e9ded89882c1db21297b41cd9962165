## **The 5-Phase Sales Framework**

### **Phase 1: Attract & Qualify**
**Objective:** Bring in high-quality leads and ensure they’re a fit for your services.

1. **Leverage Funnels for Lead Generation:**
   - Use funnels such as:
     - **Book a Call Funnel:** Drives traffic to schedule consultations&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
     - **Self-Liquidating Offer Funnel:** Generate leads while covering ad spend&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
   - Include a lead magnet (e.g., guide, video training) that solves a small but relevant problem.

2. **Implement Pre-Qualification Forms:**
   - Ask strategic questions:
     - What’s your current challenge?
     - What would solving this problem mean for you?
     - Are you ready to invest in a solution now?

3. **Use NEPQ Techniques:**
   - Probe for urgency:
     - "Why is this important for you right now?"
   - Explore consequences:
     - "What happens if you don’t solve this issue in the next six months?"

### **Phase 2: Discovery Call**
**Objective:** Build rapport, understand client needs, and position yourself as a trusted advisor.

1. **Set the Call Agenda:**
   - Example:  
     "We’ll talk about your current goals and challenges, and I’ll outline how I can help. Does that sound good?"

2. **Diagnose the Problem:**
   - Use diagnostic questioning:
     - "What’s not working for you right now?"
     - "What’s the biggest obstacle holding you back?"

3. **Gap Analysis with NEPQ:**
   - Identify the gap between where they are and where they want to be:
     - "If you don’t address this, how do you see it affecting [specific outcome]?"

4. **Position Yourself as the Solution:**
   - Highlight your expertise:
     - "Here’s how I’ve helped others in similar situations achieve [specific result]."

       "Our approach is designed to [specific benefit]."
   - **Step 3: Share Social Proof**

2. **Handle Objections:**
   - Early objections:

   - Late objections:  
     - Use the Looping Technique:
       - Restate the objection.
       - Provide a targeted resolution.
       - Confirm their alignment.

### **Phase 4: Closing**
**Objective:** Secure commitment and initiate onboarding.

1. **Summarize and Confirm:**
   - Recap the key outcomes discussed:  
     "Just to confirm, we’ll solve [problem] and help you achieve [goal]. Does that sound right?"

2. **Create a Sense of Urgency:**
   - Use time-sensitive bonuses:
     - "If we finalize today, I’ll include [bonus]."
