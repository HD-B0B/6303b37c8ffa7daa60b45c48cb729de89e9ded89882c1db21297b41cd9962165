## **6. Metrics and KPIs for Success**

### **Why Metrics Matter**
Tracking key metrics ensures your business model is performing as intended and identifies areas for improvement.

### **Core Metrics**
1. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Measure how much it costs to acquire a customer.
2. **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** Calculate the revenue generated from a customer over their lifetime.
3. **Payback Period:** Determine how quickly your CAC is recovered.
4. **Churn Rate:** Monitor the percentage of customers leaving your service.
5. **Gross Margin:** Evaluate your profitability after deducting the cost of goods sold.
6. **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** Gauge customer satisfaction and loyalty.

### **Phase Benchmarks**
- **Creation Phase**: Test customer interest (e.g., conversion rates).
- **Delivery Phase**: Optimize customer satisfaction (e.g., NPS).
- **Monetization Phase**: Assess revenue growth and profitability (e.g., CAC:LTV ratio).
- **Sustainability Phase**: Measure retention and churn rates.
