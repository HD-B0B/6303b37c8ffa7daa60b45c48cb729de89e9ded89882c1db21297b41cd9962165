## Conducting the 10-Minute Qualification Call

A concise and focused qualification call helps determine if the lead is worth pursuing further.

### Setting the Pace and Establishing Control

- **Introduction:**
    - **Greet the Client:** "Hi [Name], thank you for joining the call."
    - **Set Expectations:** "I have limited time, so I'll ask a series of questions to understand your needs better."
- **Control the Conversation:**
    - **Take Charge:** Lead the conversation to ensure all necessary topics are covered.
    - **Be Direct:** Avoid unnecessary small talk to maintain focus.

### The BANT Framework

The BANT framework helps assess the viability of a lead based on four key criteria:

#### Budget

- **Questions to Ask:**
    - "How much are you expecting to spend on this project?"
    - "Do you have a set budget allocated for this?"
- **Purpose:** Determine if the client can afford your services.

#### Authority

- **Questions to Ask:**
    - "Are you the sole decision-maker for this project?"
    - "Is there anyone else involved in the decision-making process?"
- **Purpose:** Ensure you're speaking with someone who can make purchasing decisions.

#### Need

- **Questions to Ask:**
    - "What is the primary goal you want to achieve with this project?"
    - "What challenges are you currently facing that you hope to solve?"
- **Purpose:** Understand the client's needs and how your services can address them.

#### Time

- **Questions to Ask:**
    - "When are you looking to start this project?"
    - "Is there a specific deadline you're working towards?"
- **Purpose:** Assess the urgency of the client's needs and their timeline for implementation.

#### Suppliers

- **Questions to Ask:**
    - "Are you currently working with any other consultants or agencies?"
    - "Have you tried any solutions in the past that didn't work?"
- **Purpose:** Identify existing relationships and potential competition.

### Scoring Leads with Magic M

Evaluate leads based on their responses to the BANT criteria using the Magic M system:

1. **Money (Budget):** Can they afford your services?
2. **Gains (Need):** Are their needs aligned with what you offer?
3. **Good Fit (Authority and Suppliers):** Do they have decision-making power and are they a good fit for your services?
4. **Interest (Time):** Are they interested and ready to take action now?
