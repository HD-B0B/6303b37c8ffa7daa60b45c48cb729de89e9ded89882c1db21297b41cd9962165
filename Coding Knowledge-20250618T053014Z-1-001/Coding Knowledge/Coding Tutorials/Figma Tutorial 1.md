everything before our next big video where we will design a complete SAS web application from start to finish we will also learn how to convert our application into a full stack production ready build so that you can start SAS businesses from the comfort of your own home so don't forget to hit that subscribe button so that you can get notified when those videos come out alright grab a cup of coffee and let's get ready because this video is all you need to get started in figma before we start let's understand why do we need this tool what is the purpose well figma first of all is widely used by designers around the world so that means we have a bigger Community but what is the main reason why we need figma figma allows real-time collaboration with your team so let's say you have a bunch like a bunch of designers on your team 10 designers in specific all 10 designers can work on the project at once and you can see real-time updates of what your team members are doing figma also makes it very easy to create Design Systems another good reason to use figma is they have a pretty generous free package okay so I just open an account with figma so go ahead and start a free plan account and you will notice that they create a team for you right so where you are right now is called a file browser in the file browser you can see your recent Pages your drafts and your team right so go ahead and create a team so right now it's called parent Joseph's team I'm going to change that to web prodigies once you're done creating a team you can create a project so let's go ahead and call this how to use figma and let's create the project so now we have our project here so let's open our project and let's create a design file so let's go ahead and open that and it will take you to this page I'm going to go ahead and hit no thanks here so let's understand what are we seeing on the page right now so this is where you can do all your mock-ups designing work etc right so on the left side we have a sidebar this sidebar basically shows you all of your components and all of your layers that are on the page it's kind of like Photoshop right in Photoshop you can see each layer so for example if you created a frame don't get confused I mean don't worry about this we'll learn everything in a second but you see it says we have a frame on the page and you can now click on this Frame and it will kind of highlight the frame for you so this is where you can see all your layers in figma what about this it shows you all the tools that you can use such as creating text guys it's like paint right there's it's the same thing it's just much better I promise you it is super simple so before we get started I want you all to believe that this is really easy and it is possible right so let's understand this what is this these are just a bunch of shapes if you used canva it's pretty similar right you can create a bunch of shapes this is a frame we'll get we will get to all that in a second but just showing you that this is where you can get access to all the tools in figma so this right here is the plugins the plug-in section is what you'll be using a lot okay and the plugin section allows you to search up plugins created by the community and you can reuse them in your figma projects so what about this side so this right side is basically like a settings tab right it has a properties some design settings so let's say if we had a frame for example you can change the color it's like Photoshop you see this you can change um uh let's see you can change its opacity right you can do a bunch of stuff here so this is sort of like the settings uh sidebar right so the left side shows you the layers the top gives you access to all the tools and the right side just gives you the settings for your elements or your layers so let's understand how to create stuff in figma so the first thing you want to do is create a frame what is a frame and why do we need a frame so think about it this way right when you need to create a section to group all your elements you'd probably want to put in a little box right think about a frame like that okay there's also something called a section but let's not get confused with that for now a frame is what we need to sort of create a starting point within which we will create all our layouts so let's create a frame and we want this Frame to be the starting point for our website so the shortcut is to hit F and for frame easy right and in sort of drawing our frame right that would be very hard to predict all screen sizes figma makes it super easy for you so when you hit F here it will give you a bunch of options such as tablet phone desktop Etc so let's go ahead and just create a desktop and now whatever you put in there like a rectangle or a circle everything it's all within that frame let's understand how to use these shapes why would we need to use these shapes well we might need to use shapes like rectangles to create maybe our nav bar up top or maybe an image for a hero page some headers like this into body text with our CTA right and maybe we can give up order radius you see well this is awful but you see how this comes in handy and shapes are of course used for other things too not just mock-ups such as building logos or even much more complex illustrations so to create a rectangle you can hit r r for rectangle and you can draw a rectangle right here inside the frame you can also hit shift to lock in the ratio what about a circle you can hit o to create a circle another thing you're going to need is a line and the shortcut is l l for line you can click and drag to create a line and you can also hit a shift again to kind of lock it onto the axis if you hold shift and L it will draw a line with an arrow at the end and of course you can also do command Z to undo right like every application you can undo stuff and redo stuff by hitting shift command Z to redo and command Z to undo so to create text you can hit T click anywhere you want the text to be and you can just write something so let's just say how to use figma and now you can also zoom in so if you have a trackpad you can I'm using a trackpad right now so you can just zoom in like how you'd zoom in on an iPhone screen to see an image and you can also move your text to anywhere in the page right so let's say we want to move it up top here you can move it there so what if you want to change the properties of anything whether it's a rectangle or a circle or the frame itself or the text itself well if you want to change the settings of anything you want to go to the right side always remember that if you want to find something you're going to go to the left sidebar if you want to edit the settings of something you want to go to the right sidebar so right now we want to change the font to DM sand so we're going to click on the text that we want to and you can also do it by clicking this right of course so you can click this text here and go here where it has the font option and you can change that to DM Sans for example and there you go the font has changed you can also change it to medium or bold you can change the font size right and another cool thing is if you hold down option you can drag this number to increase it to so let's say you know sometimes if you go to the largest number 128 here you want to go larger than that you can hit option and go higher than that right this is a pretty useful shortcut so what is this this is line height so let's say if we created how to use figma by web prodigies right so you see the distance between the first line and the second line you see there's a little bit of a distance right that is called line height if you select all your font you can control the line height between them right here so right now we are reducing it and increasing it this is the spacing between the letters if you increase it it just changes the spacing between them so let's say you increase this box here you can tell figma to start all the text from The Middle right or from the top or from the bottom and if you want more finer tweaking adjustments you can hit this more option type setting and it will show up a bunch of things that you could use such as list Styles or you can create a case system like lowercase for example you can also do underlining so much more so what about these options so right here we're telling figma that you want this text box to automatically adjust the width so if I enter words here like whatever it will automatically adjust the whip for this text box but let's say you wanted the width to be fixed and the height to be automatic well that would be the next option so this option right here would say Auto height which means the width would be fixed but if you enter anything after that it will go to the next line This option is fixed size where if you click this it will not grow in width or in height so let's understand the pen tool the pen tool allows you to create vectors so you see right here it creates a vertice or point and you can use that point to kind of create a design you can also click and drag to create a curve in your design so here's a quick test for you right we want to change the settings of this Vector design if you want to change the settings of anything in figma where should you look if you said the right sidebar good job so all these options on the right sidebar allow you to control the settings of this Vector drawing probably change the width of the stroke right to 22 to 15 to whatever you want and you can also change the colors you can click on this black box and change the color to anything you want what about fill well the word itself kind of tells you right fill to fill this Vector with anything so you can fill things in figma with the color or you can fill it with a gradient and you can see the transparency from this option right here you also have images at the bottom so now you can click here you can upload any image that you have all right let's look at section so section is actually a little more complex than what people think people think a section is something like you know creating a section and you can group all your elements of course you can do that but I came to know that sections are actually used for prototyping but for now you can wrap all your designs in a section to kind of have a systematic drop down right for all your elements and all your layers in your figma file another tool that I wanted to touch on is the create component so the word itself says it right if you create an element let's say you create a rectangle you can create a component out of it simple right so this can be very handy because if you create components out of your elements or your layers you can reuse your components across your entire project and when you change styling on the master component that will affect every element in your figma project that saves you a lot of time alright now let's jump into some more fun stuff okay let's say we want to create Global styling we want to create a color swatch that we can use in our entire figma project the one way to do this is to create a style out of it click this style button right here and this will show you a bunch of color styles in your project through which you can also browse for other color styles but right now we're going to create a template color of this so you can use it for other elements so you can hit the plus icon to create a style out of it give it a name and maybe you can call it primary red and maybe you can give it a description uh you don't really need to do that but you can give it a name and hit create style and we want to reuse this red color primary color for this circle by default figma will give you a fill right here you can see it right this subtract icon or minus icon allows you to delete the fill for that so let's give it a fill so we can hit this style layout and you can look for the color primary red and I can select that and now the styling is used for all elements now let's say in the future you want to edit this primary red right your partners told you hey I don't like this red I want it to be a little darker you can click on your styling right here and hit the edit edit style right here and now you can change this and it will change it for all your elements in your file of course you can create template styles for other properties too like stroke or effects right this way you can reuse a box Shadow for example another thing I want to touch on is how layers work in figma so let's say we have a rectangle right you can see our rectangle right here and we have two rectangles let's give this a color of color red and give this a color of color blue so even though we created both rectangles on the same plane you will notice that the red rectangle which is at the bottom is behind the blue rectangle elements that appear up top up here on the top layer and elements that are at the bottom appear at the bottom layer so here's a quick question for you if I want to create a circle that lays in between these two layers how would I do that well I hope you got the right answer but if you said first create a circle and then move the layers accordingly that's the correct answer right now we can move our elements along the layers panel so we're going to move our Circle in between the rectangles and there you go that's how that works you know also move elements outside of a flow so you can move it outside of your desktop so now the circle is basically placed behind your desktop elements that are on top are basically on top of your file right they're on top of everything and elements at the bottom are all the way behind so that's why this circle is behind this section because the section is all the way up top now let's understand a few more properties so we have a rectangle here a very common thing that you would do in designing is creating a curve around these rectangles zoom in if you don't see this dot sometimes that happens right like see for example I don't see the dot right now so if I zoom in a little dot will appear here and that is that allows you to control the radius this is how you can create a curve for the borders another way to do this is to click on your element and head over to the properties tab right remember if you want to change the settings for any elements look at the right side Tab and there's this little thing you see here right it says Corner radius so if you hover over thing things it's going to tell you what it is so this is Corner radius so let's go ahead and give this 21 pixel Corner radius and that's how it works now what if you want to only give it a right top right radius so this allows you to control independent Corners so you can click this and now you can control each individual border radius so what about drop Shadows well we use that a lot too so how do we do that again when you want to control these settings for an element you head over to the right tab right so everything is supposed to be here nowhere else right so if you head down you will see stroke and then you will see effects if you click on effects it will add a drop shadow by default there are multiple options such as inner Shadow drop shadow layer blur and background blur for drop shadow if you want a fine tweak everything you can click on this effect setting looks like a like a sun icon and you can change the blur or you can also move the drop shadow around using the X and Y axis you can also change the color of the drop shadow now what is layer blur layer blur basically places a blur effect on the entire layer itself that's why this rectangle right now looks really blurry so of course you can increase the blur to create this little I don't know gradient effect or whatever you want to call it and what about background blur now this is a little different so let's understand how this works let's reduce the opacity so what background blur does is it puts a blur layer inside this element it doesn't put it on the entire layer but it just puts it inside this it's the background so now when you change this it kind of creates this really cool glass morphic design look this is how you can create that really cool glass frosted glass like effect so what are Auto layouts Auto layouts allow you to control the alignment and positioning of direct child elements within a frame so if you had a bunch of cards on the screen that are within a frame you can give it a layout flow a good use case of this would be let's say if you had a bunch of cards that on a desktop view was supposed to be horizontally stacked and on a mobile view has to be vertically stacked all you have to do is just switch it to a vertically stacked layout system and that's that's it it's already set up for mobile device now another reason why we use Auto layouts is to create fluid designs or we like to say responsive designs for example with auto layouts we can set elements to be aligned in a certain way in the frame so that when the frame grows and shrinks the elements also respond accordingly okay so let's see how to build Auto out in figma so let's try to build a very simple product landing page right so we have a bunch of products here right one two three right we just made them um random size for now I'll show you why but um you see these can represent the product image for example and let's use a plug-in here so we're going to use unsplash which makes adding images to the background of a element super easy so we'll just look for a product for example let's put this in here to convert something into an auto layout you want to select all the elements and hit shift a and that will create an auto layout you can see it wraps all your direct children inside a frame or right click and add Auto layout another powerful feature of Auto layouts is the ability to adjust the spacing right the margin between your child elements globally so you can you can use this Arrow to kind of increase the distance or you could also click on your auto layout itself and then head to this part right here which says horizontal space between items and you can adjust the space between them right the other options you get through Auto layouts are alignment so let's try Center for now so what does Center do let's see if we increase the size of this container what we're basically saying is all the children items inside this Auto layout should be centered inside this Frame so that's why everything is right in the center and it has the space in between them too if you put left top corner it will all go to the left top Corner whereas if it was a line left Center then you see if you increase the height it will also align the children items vertically and make sure that they are on the left side of your frame remember I also told you you can change the layout flow of your children elements let's take a look at that so right here you see it says vertical layout and horizontal layout if you click on these you can easily toggle between two different layout flows right it's super easy and this way we can convert for example a bunch of cards that we are using on a desktop view right here we can now convert that into a iPhone view right by just okay copying it pasting it here and changing the auto layouts makes it really easy to work with um responsive design another very important feature is the Advanced Auto layout settings if you click on this you can now set the spacing in the uh the spacing modes for your direct children elements so right now it is in spacing packed and let's change that to space between so don't worry about this we'll get more into this in a bit but I just want to show you uh the power of Auto layouts so what about your child elements right now all our child elements have a fixed height and a fixed width how can I tell that well from here if you click on your child element it will tell you if it is a fixed width or a fixed height so what we want to do is we want to change the height to fill container for all of them now you'll notice that our child elements take up the space available uh vertically so if you increase the container size well if you guess right right the child elements are also going to respond accordingly so there you go and of course you can also set the width to fill the container too and now if you increase the height and the width the elements will accordingly scale so really helps in building responsive layouts what does space between mean space between means take the first child element and place it towards the starting of your auto layout and it will take the last element and place it on the ending of your auto layout so our start and ending here because this is a horizontal layout is the starting is the left side and the ending is the right side and all other children will be spaced between the first child and the last child and they'll be spaced equally so if we duplicated something in here you will see there's equal space between all of these so let's look at a real world example where we would use this space between if you were to build this header in figma you would want to create three children right the left side the middle and the right side exactly what we have right here say if this is the logo and your links might be this long so I'm just going to create a box to simulate that and for our final element we can create the call to action right here right and now you can select all of these and hit shift a which will create an auto layout for us and now you can move it to the top of the page but remember you need to select your auto layout flow or else it's not going to work right if you extend the screen it's not going to be responsive so you want this header to extend to the right side and the left side you also want it to have the space between to create this effect click on your auto layout go to Advanced Auto layout settings and change the spacing mode to space between now you pretty much build Tesla's header in figma now let's understand constraints what are constraints so the word again every word should probably give you a hint right and I want you guys to make a guess because this is a very important skill as a developer or a designer you have to have the ability to guess if you can guess if someone asks you a question in an interview or if they put you on the spot during a meeting for example in the ask you hey parent tell me um what is uh what is this let me tell you a little secret nobody knows what it is right you have to have the ability to guess so this is how I train every single student of mine I make them guess on the spot to teach you and prep you for Enterprise Level Training I want you to guess what constraints are doing by reading this word constrained sounds like some sort of setting that sets a a boundary of some sort or some kind of restriction right that's exactly what constraints are doing it allows you to create these restrictions for your element so that it can respond to the constraints accordingly so right now an element will have constraints set to its nearest parent so since this has a left side constraint it means the left side will respond to the left side of its parent current element which is this desktop frame so if I shrink this Frame right now you will see that it's going to move with respect to that constraint so what about the right side so the way to create a right constraint is to hit command and then click your constraint so then it creates another constraint for you so you can adjust your constraints further by hitting the drop down here this is going to create a constraint for your element to the right side of its parent element and left side of the parent element and also the top of your parent element so if I shrink this desktop it's going to move with it and if I shrink it from the left it's going to shrink with respect to both left and right so this is the power of constraints okay let's do a quick little checkpoint assignment the element we're going to be building is this bottom nav bar right here don't worry about this icon if you don't know how to do it right now just figure out how to get elements on the left side and on the right side so go ahead and pause this video give it a shot take a challenge no problem if you can't do it if you can't come right back to this video in a couple seconds I will show you exactly how to do it so the first thing we realize is these are all a bunch of links right so let's first create a link element that we can sort of uh reuse in here usually we would create a component but for now since we didn't get into components yet let's just create an element and duplicate it so we're just going to use one word for now so let's use home set this to around 16 pixel which is sort of the default that we use for font on desktop devices and let's also give this a regular let's copy paste this right next to each other and now we can select these and give it an auto layout so what is the auto layout shortcut it's shift a we can duplicate all these elements inside this and we did this by simply doing command D and auto layout will automatically place the elements next to each other what about the other link on the right side let's go ahead and create another one in here for our right side and let's delete some that we don't need you can also use this side to delete them so we have two elements right there and a bunch of elements on our left side now to create this Auto layout to have these elements show up on the left and this on the right I hope you did this right but if not no worries you want to select them both and hit shift a to create an auto layout for them so now you have an auto layout frame right here that has two frames the left side frame and the right side frame so these are the direct children to this parent the next thing we want to do is we want to align this to the left side of our desktop and align this to the right side and now we want this to go to the right side of our screen in this on the left side so the way to do that is to use space between other thing we realize is it looks like it has a little bit of padding you can create some horizontal padding so you can create some space right here and maybe some padding at the top and bottom is this responsive no why is it not responsive can you make a guess we have not set any constraints on our elements so let's go ahead and set a constraint for this element which is left and right and now if you shrink the parent you will see these elements are responsive let's move on to the next part which is how to build components right so in our last test we had to duplicate each of these links to create you know multiple links but there is a problem there what if these links were much more complex like what if they had a line below them if they were selected or it can be as complex as you need it to so as you can see maybe copy pasting these elements can be a little tedious especially if you need to change the styling for one of them you would have to change it for all let's say you wanted to remove this now you have to do it for all of that that's a little tedious so we're going to create the link component for that nav bar so let's hit T to create the text we put the text in here and we're just going to call this uh home for now and now all you have to do to convert this into a component is scroll to the top and hit create component or you can right click and also hit create component like this and now you'll see this little purple outline around it and figma is also telling you hey you can pick your assets from the assets tab so if you were wondering why didn't we look at this asset tab it's because we're just waiting for the right moment so the first thing you want to do after you create a component is give it a better name so let's just call this link component and in your assets it will also be called link component let's change our component to also say link all right so once you renamed your component you might see that sometimes the component does not resize to fit it right because you see the the text is smaller and your link is a different size it's still the same well you can head over right here and this is a resize to fit shortcut that you can click and your component will then resize to fit the elements inside so figma allows us to create component States or different variants for these components too and this is where components become really powerful because let's say this link is supposed to be lighter when it is not active then we would need to have a different component variant for this right it's very easy to do that all you have to do is click on your component go up here and hit variant and we're going to change change this to state right because for our link component it's going to have two states for now one is an active State and a default state so this is the active state so let's change that to active the second one is going to have default and let's also change the color for this element the way to get to the text is to double click another shortcut is to hold command on Mac and click on the link directly that will click the text for you or the innermost components or elements for you so since this is a default link we want it to be a little lighter you can also create other properties for your components for example you can create Boolean values or instant swaps so as you can see right here some of the links have this icon so we want to have the flexibility of turning that icon on and off for each of our component variants so first we would have to create our text and we would call this link for example give it 16 pixels and now we need to create an icon so we'll go in here and this is a plugin called icons 8 you can just run this plugin we'll paste our bookmark icon and sometimes you'll notice that it it just pastes the elements outside your uh your frame you can just drag it in there and let's resize this so this is a PNG image you never want to use PNG for icons you always want to use svgs but that is a paid tool unfortunately but that's fine there are plenty of free community icons available in figma right that you can access for free so since this is just for learning purpose we're just going to use this PNG right here so first thing we need to do is we want to create an auto layout for this so that we can control the alignment of these links so shift a will create our Auto layout let's also shrink this image a little bit it's a little too big what do you think that looks better let's create a component out of this and let's also create a very out of this so now we have two variants we have our default variant and our active variant so let's set those properties on that and change this so State and let's just change that to active and for this one we'll change it to default so this is the problem with pngs right you can change the color this is why you need to use svgs but I'm just going to change the opacity Now to create an option to show or hide this right all you want to do is create another property hit Boolean and let's call that icon and we'll set we'll set that to false all right so now that we created our Boolean property we want to have the ability to turn it off and on whenever we want it right so how do we do that so you want to click on the elements that you want to apply this Boolean property to and you'll see here on the layer through this pass through if this was off the element will not show right so this little icon here allows you to apply a Boolean property to that pass-through layer right so if you click on that and you hit icon now this this little tag it creates this tag for you that shows that these icons are now attached to this passthrough right so if you create an instance of this component you can do that by going into your asset and dragging in your component in here now you have access to the default State or the active State and also the icon or no icon and with the help of components you can change this at any time you could turn this icon on or you could change it to active whatever you want you would want this whole nav bar to show up on all these pages so building a component out of that would make more sense so let's go ahead and do that what if we wanted to create a variant for this for mobile view let's click this add a variant for mobile view we probably don't want this right side so we're going to create a quick little hamburger menu which looks like this let's select this use Auto layout too again and command D so as you can see we have three elements in here right and sometimes all these elements could have different colors and it could be quite annoying to get into the element to select and then change the color for them well section colors tells us that in this section these are the colors that are available to change so let's say for example if this was red color and we wanted to change the red color we could just select the whole element and then in the section color you can change each of them this makes it easy to Target some specific styling or colors Etc so right now we're going to change this to Black so this looks a little too tiny for a hamburger menu so this is a good time to also bring up the scale tool so the scale tool allows you to scale an element or a component but also keep the ratio so to scale anything just use a scale tool and the shortcut is K and now we can simply drag this into our Auto layout and it will paste it in there for us and since we don't want this right side and go ahead and delete that so now we have two variants for our navigation another important Concept in figma are grids so let's look at what a grid system can help us do the grids allow us to create some guidelines that we can follow to make sure that our elements are perfectly aligned right so let's see how to do that so to create a grid system for your frame you want to click on your frame head over to your properties Tab and click the plus icon for your layout grid and that will create a grid for us but we want column head to grid here and create columns and for desktop the standard is 12 counts right so 12 columns and we like to set the margin again you can use that option uh shortcut and usually it's around 45 pixels well this it's not seven Stone but you can put what you whatever you want and for iPad you can set it to 8 which is the standard again and we'll give it a margin of about um 35 pixels and finally for mobile you want to set a grid column with a count of four and again you can give this a slight bit of a margin maybe 25 now whatever elements you build you can use this grid system to create Pixel Perfect elements right so if you create a rectangle let's say on our mobile device we have a product so it will snap to the edge of this grid for you so that way you can you can make sure that all elements are perfectly aligned you can also turn off your grid by hitting shift G and you can turn it on by hitting shift G again so now it's time to design and we're going to be designing this new product from Apple called Vision Pro first thing we're going to build is this header and the other thing you notice is a logo here and two icons a search icon and this cart icon okay so I'm just going to show you how to build one of these icons and then we're just going to use the plugin so first we're going to use a frame and build a 24 by 24 frame to kind of encapsulate all of our icon content and let's also give it a background color so we can differentiate from our assets and the background and first thing we need is another rectangle to create this um the uh the bag itself right and let's reduce its height a little bit and let's give it a stroke and let's give this stroke probably I think 1.5 is okay right that looks okay and uh it also has to be a little shorter so we'll do this to it now to create that Arc let's use a circle and we can do that like this and if you hit option H it will Center the circle in the frame so that's another quick little tip there and you see this Arc here if you drag this it will split the circle in half and you know you can kind of move this around and create whatever shapes you like so we want this and this one allows you to decrease the ratio from inside so this looks fine to me and I'm also going to give this a background of black for now and then we'll figure out the other stuff later and let's give this a border radius so a border radius of maybe three that looks it looks fine this looks more longer right so let's try to do that too why not so let's decrease the width here and decrease the width here too hit option H to Center that let's move this higher up and we can increase the height of the square so now it looks more like this icon right here the icon is also white so let's go ahead and do that so here's the other thing that we learned you can use the selection color and you can change all colors at once so we want to change the black colors to White so now you see how we can use that tool and it makes it really easy right and I also realize this rectangle has a fill so let's remove that fill too so now we create our first icon so you can go ahead and also create this this icon and the Apple logo but um I'm just going to use the icon library to sort of speed up our process now all right so I went ahead and created three more icons here and I just want to show you something really cool and it's called instant swaps instant swaps is a component feature a property that allows you to instantly swap a component with another component or another variant right so that can be very useful in icons for example let's say we wanted to change this icon to a cart icon what you would have to do if you didn't use instant swaps is you would have to copy this component and then delete this one and paste it in there right it's a lot of work whereas imagine if you could just hit a drop down and change it so I'll show you how to do that and this is how we build um Global icon sets for big projects right so the first thing you want to do is you want to select the components uh the sorry you want to select your icons that you created and you want to hit on this drop down and hit create multiple components so each one of these are going to be components of their own okay that's the first thing you want to do now the next thing you want to do is you want to create a frame outside here and convert it to a auto layout so do shift a and now you want to create an instance of this so hit option and drag it into this Auto layout and now you will see that auto layout that we created now has the new instance cart component inside it right so let's just reset it has some unnecessary padding so let's just remove that remove the top uh padding too now we have this component so this is a frame that has a component inside it now click the frame and I'll create another component out of that frame now what you're going to do is you're going to click on this cart icon component that's inside here click on it and this instant swap property will show up okay this basically allows you to convert a component into a different variant so what you're going to do is you're going to click this instant Swap and it's going to bring this up and you're going to hit this plus icon and now you can select all the different type of variants you want for it and just hit create property now when you create an instance of this right let's say you created an instance of this but you don't want this you can just change it to another component so the first thing we need to do is change the background the background looks black color right here so let's go ahead and change that to Black perfect and now what's the next thing so for our header we also need link elements we get T we put we click and then we say link let's bring this down change this to DM stands I like Dan stands for now so we'll just keep it at that and let's change the font size to 16 we want to create a component out of it right so go ahead and hit this right here create component and to create a variant and call this default default and for this we're active our default color text color from white to slightly a little gray right a little grayed out and you can also search your icon itself okay if you gave it a name you can search your icon so let's drag the Apple logo in here next thing we need is a link so let's get our link paste the link in here so first you want to select these two and then hit shift a which will create an auto layout so it's easier for you to just duplicate these and the auto layout will put it side by side we need our search component let's pull that in here and we need our cart icon let's pull that in here too so now here's a good part of creating components right so you can you can shrink them down if you need to so you can hit K and just shrink them down a little and now they will shrink everywhere in your application so since we are on the vision page I'm going to click on this link and convert it into active all right and now we're just going to go ahead and reduce this margin and we can hit option H remember to Center our elements we need to stretch them from left side to right side to kind of create that nav bar everything's in the center if we put it on the left side we see it will go to the left but uh we want it to be right in the center so we're going to do that and let's also go ahead and see our grid layout so that way we can align this perfectly with our grid layout right so everything is responsive and now we want our navbar to also have some padding inside and that way we can move this to the top of our page let's also give this a left and right so that way when we shrink or navbar also shrinks the next thing is we need a Vision Pro and a button here so the quickest way to create a button is to First create some text so notify me and now hit shift a to convert that into an auto layout and that kind of creates some padding for us it kind of makes it look like a button right and this is actually a part of figma figma is clever enough to know that this is supposed to be a button so if you want to build buttons really quick you can do it this way we're going to create some border radius for this so let's give it like 32 pixel and let's also give it a background color so put a fill here and we can give that white and the text itself let's give it black and we can also decrease the padding from top to bottom a little bit now going back to our page we can click on the assets and drag our button in here and we can put that right there and we also need this Vision Pro so usually what you would do is you would have typography settings if you recollect we did set Global styling through this for um style icon right here and this allows us to create some typography so what you would do is you would usually have a typography page very similar to the one you see on the screen right now that has all your Global styling but just to make things easy for now let's go ahead and create some text and call it Vision Pro and let's give it a font size of 26 pixels and let's make this medium now you want to select both the button and this and again create an auto layout so shift a right and now you want to Center elements to the left side now you may ask wait you centered it to the left side but why are these elements to the left and right because you created the auto layout with the elements so far apart igma went ahead and created a padding between them of 772 pixels so let's delete that so finally we need to put this image all right perfect so for the image let's go ahead and drag the image in here I just took a screenshot of the image from their page okay so now what you want to do is you want to click on your image and you want to change it from fill to fit and um the other thing is you want to change its constraints too so let's set this to left and right and this can be from this can be from the top now when you shrink your page you will notice that the image also shrinks how to create the other headings which is Introduction and after that let's put this Vision Pro right here and let's increase the size of these and once that's done we want to select this and this and hit shift a to create an auto layout now the same thing goes for all the other devices so when we shrink the browser you'll notice that only the icons stay and all the navigation everything just disappears the second header also sticks to the left and right side as well as the header two what I'd like to do is I'd like to copy this paste it in our component frame let's create a component out of it and let's change the name to navigation and let's also create a variant for it now in our second variant we need to remove all the links so let's select all these components and simply just delete them the other thing you're going to notice is the Apple logo is towards the left whereas these icons are on the right and there's a hamburger menu that we need to create so let's create that hamburger menu real quick select these change the color to white so I'm just going to group this for now you can create a component out of it if you liked and I'm just going to paste it into this so now we have all the components but they are not aligned correctly so another cool thing with auto layouts is when you create groups between items it sort of you know creates um a set right like it's it becomes one direct child and we can either convert this into a group or you can create this into another Auto layout so let's just do shift a to create an auto layout out of this and now we can control the spacing between these elements so here's a quick question for you if I want to set this to have this child on the left and this child on the right how do I do that good if you set click here and change this to space between you got it perfectly correct let's also change the names these are very important so we'll call this variant and we'll change this to uh desktop web and for this we'll change it to mweb and now in all our devices we can bring in our navigation component or we can change it to mobile web and we can adjust this to be side to side you can do the same for your Vision Pro component too so copy the other two things so let's paste that in here align this by doing option H to be align Center we can follow this system here for the mobile view it's pretty much the same thing let's copy this and paste it in here we want to do option h and we can bring this introduction here hit option H to center it option H for the Vision Pro looks a little too big so let's hit K and kind of scale that down a little bit and now you can move it up and also hit option H to Center that in the next video we will build a full design system using components icons color palettes responsive designs for both desktop and mobile devices we will also look at prototyping and how you can create beautiful mockups to show to your clients I really
