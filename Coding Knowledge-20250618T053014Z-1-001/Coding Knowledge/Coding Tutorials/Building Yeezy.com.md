Title: Building Yeezy.com - Nextjs15, Rapyd Cloud, WordPress Headless, WooCommerce

---

WordPress the industry's leading content management system that makes building scalable websites a breeze but what if I told you that with this tool alone you could build a website that can handle millions of concurrent users just like yeezy.com a website that sells e-commerce products that gets millions of visitors per day and that's exactly what we're going to be building today and e-commerce store for Kanye because right now it looks like his site doesn't even have any products now our e-commerce store is going to be using Wordpress as a headless CMS with woocommerce and we're going to be using NEX js15 as our front end and the cool part is our e-commerce store can scale to millions of concurrent users at once so this video can help you if you're just looking to learn how to use WordPress as a headless cems for your frontend application so first we will set up WordPress locally this way we can test and build the website on our machine next we will build the front-end application which will look very similar to what he's had in the past and finally we'll look at what to consider for hosting but before we move forward the sponsor of today's coffee is Allan thank you so much for giving back to us this way we can give you so much more free value just like this and also we hit 100,000 subscribers so thank you so much for this I've been waiting for one year and we finally got this and honestly it it just feels unreal uh I mean it's only we've only posted 10 videos and if you're wondering how hard you got to work to get one of these just spend one year lock yourself in a room give away all the things that you would charge $1,000 for just post 10 videos 10 extremely valuable videos because that's how that's how many videos we posted as long as you can do that you'll make it as well so thank you so much for joining this journey now if you haven't subscribed I think you might want to because the type of projects that we build is something that you will not find on YouTube so by subscribing you get notified when these awesome projects come out so don't forget to subscribe because because we might just never meet again with that being said let's jump straight right into this video so this is the website that we're going to be building Kanye West now this design is very similar to what yeezy.com had in the past which makes our life super easy Noe pun intended and the reason is simply because they have a minimal branding design and so this project is literally for anybody even if you are a beginner you will know how to build this from start to finish now first of all we're going to have a cart right here where you can take a look at the items in your cart and you also have a toggle up here to show more menu items which you can of course add in the future now if you take a look here when you hover over each product you can see the name and the price when you click on the product itself that takes you into the product Details page and notice how blazing fast everything loads and this is exactly why we need to use WordPress as a backend because data is served insanely fast because of light speeed technology now when I click on on one of these products I can read the description and I can add one of the products to my cart I can also add multiple quantities of the products as well so for example I'm just going to keep this at one so I can demo the rest of this application as well so let's go back to our cart right here and if you click on the cart it's going to show you that you have one of these added to your cart you can also increment this up and down and it's going to reflect all the way at the bottom in the subtotal and then you can click on the checkout when you click on checkout it's going to take you to a stripe page with the updated payment showing the exact quantity that you purchased and the total amount that's pretty much it so let's jump straight into this project so the first thing I would do is join our free Discord channel so go ahead grab your phone and scan this barcode it's going to take you into our Discord Channel web prodigies where you can get access to all of the assets that we build and give out for free U not only for this video but for also all of our future projects as well so for example you see Vivid spoiler plate code is put in here that way you don't have to copy paste I mean you don't have to type anything and you can use similar assets uh that we're using in the project the other thing is not only are you going to get access to assets you're also going to get access to a thriving Community there's about 7,000 SAS developers around the world who are building and launching their own SAS so you can take a look at what they're doing learn from them see how much they're making see if it's you know your ideas are feasible um and also help them you know all that kind of stuff so we're just building a great community so don't forget to join uh the web prodigies Discord Channel okay once that's done the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a folder and please name it as such so web prodigies D- Yeezy okay and then you want to drag it and drop it into your Visual Studio code now you can use bun you can use pretty much you know npm pnpm whatever you want I'm going to use bun so I'm going to say bun X create-- apppp at latest and put a space and put a period sign okay and go ahead and hit enter and for typescript hit yes for ES lint yes Tailwind yes for Source I'm actually going to hit no and app router we want to hit yes turbo pack yes and no for import Alias and that's going to install everything okay for this project I just want to use the app router just to keep things simple next go ahead and open up a tab and you want to look up local WordPress okay you're going to find this application go ahead and install this app so this is essentially just going to help us uh pretty much set up WordPress locally and then once we're ready to deploy then I'll show you how to do that as well but for now uh we just want WordPress locally so we don't have to pay when we're just developing and then once we're done developing then we can focus on what we need to do for deployment so now I'm just going to click on this I already went ahead and installed it but make sure you install inst it's completely free install this for your device I'm using Mac so I'm going to go ahead and do that right now okay so once you're done you might see this page if you already have an account but if you don't go ahead sign in log in do all that kind of stuff and then you're going to see maybe a create site button on the page I see it at the bottom left corner so if it's an if it's your first account first project you might not you know have the same layout but uh make sure you have something like this or click you know add new site or local site so I'm going to go ahead and click on that then it's going to take you into this page where it says create new site click on that and then click continue then for this you can give it whatever name you want I'm going to call it web prodigies Yeezy okay like this and uh once this is done you can look at the advanced options you can change this as well but I want to set it uh to the same that it already has then click continue click on preferred click continue and for this please set to admin and for password set it to whatever you want but you can just keep it simple right just use admin okay um so once that's done you can go ahead and click on ADD site and that's going to spin up a site for you so let's just give that a second all right so once that's done you should see stop site up here that means it's actually running and you'll also see that it has this green icon right here okay so go ahead and click on um WP which means WordPress admin it's going to take you to the admin dashboard and I'm going to set the exact uh password and the email that we just created right so go ahead and put that in and then go ahead and click on login and that should take you into your dashboard now as you all know we are going to be using Wordpress with woocommerce and if you don't know what that is well think about it this way it's a super awesome plugin that does everything e-commerce related such as creating a store a checkout a cart all that kind of stuff done for you through a plugin right and so this means you can speed up the process of building your applications and the cool stuff here is we're using Wordpress as a backend for our next JS application so um in the start of this video I probably explained even more in depth in detail as to what we're going to be doing and why we can do this why we can use WordPress as a backend and why we need to in the first place and so you can watch that to get more of an idea of how all of this works right but the whole point here is we want to speed up our process of creating store and so that's why we're going to need woocommerce so go ahead and click on this and let's first install that plugin so click on plugins click on add new plugin and then you want to look up woo Commerce or I think this should find it okay and you're going to find woocommerce like this please do not download any other plugin that has these weird names that say woocommerce all right it's this one so woocommerce click on install now and then let's just give that a second and then once that's done go ahead and activate the this plugin as well okay and now it it might take you into a page like this you don't have to set up the store it's already done I believe um you can just click on skip guided step uh setup process and uh this should be fine let me just set United States okay and then click on continue and that's just going to spin up some boilerplate stuff for us now typically speaking yes you might have to fill in all of this information from a you know maybe a production standpoint to give your store info but we don't need that what we're going to do is we're going to go to products so click on the sidebar go to products and just go to all products so now you shouldn't see anything here because we don't have a product uh right now right so let's go ahead and grab our um our assets folder from Discord first and then we're going to proceed okay so I'm all set I got my product I got I mean everything that I need so go ahead and click on create product and I'm also using chat gbt just to speed up the process so I'm going to copy a product name let's cancel this I don't need that and then I also have a description so let me go ahead and copy a description just use the ones that are inside the um inside the starter kit or the boiler plate stuff okay the assets folder essentially so once that's done if you scroll down here you will see product image and if you in desktop mode it might be on the right side okay and you want to you could either add a description sorry you could either add a product image or a product Gallery but I'm just going to make it simple for now just to show you how to do this and I'll be using product image so go ahead and click on set product image and let's upload that file all right so I just went ahead and dropped one of the images from the assets folder and go ahead and click on set product image and then once you're done scroll down here to where you see regular price and just set something on it for now so I'm just going to make this 799 okay um absolutely no remorse and then we're we're going to go into chat GPT or actually sorry you will get it in the assets folder so copy the description for this specific product name which is this one right here okay so product name and a description for that product as well and go ahead and publish okay now like I said woocommerce is amazing because it takes all of the heavy lifting of creating a very complex you know system that handles I mean useless things like you don't have to build all of this you don't have to build a a inventory tracking system it's already done for you right so for example you can go and look at woocommerce orders and you can see how many orders your customers have placed you can you can also track them add tracking details everything is done for you so you don't have to waste your time and you can go live today make money right now okay and um if you have an xjs application that's why using something like WordPress as a backend is so nice because now you just have to change it in here and it changes across your store right okay cool so now now we already uh added a product let's go ahead and create a key so we can grab all of this information so go ahead and click on woocommerce then click on setting then click on Advanced click on rest API and now we're going to have the ability to get a rest API key okay so go ahead and click on create key I'm not going to show you this key but I'm going to show you how to put that into your environment folder first so create a environment file sorry so create a EnV file and inside this file I'm going to basically have the following Keys now this will also be there inside the Discord so that way you don't have to type all of the stuff right so I'm going to paste this in here which is the uh the WordPress the sorry the woocommerce consumer and secret key and then we also have stripe stuff right to accept payments so let's go ahead and bring that in now the next thing is I'm going to go ahead go ahead and pause the screen and do this so please make sure you create this key it's going to ask you for a description for the key or like a name provide that uh I would suggest call it products like this okay without any uh spaces or anything just products and then after that uh you're going to get the keys paste them in here all right and once you're done go ahead and click on U advanced again and click on rest API same thing under the woocommerce settings right just to ensure that you see the word products right here okay if you don't see this it means it didn't create that rest API key so make sure that key is created and once you're done with this then we can proceed to the other parts of building this application all right now the next thing we want to do is install shaty nuui so go ahead and open up the shat Nui website click on installation click on nextjs copy this Command right here and then paste it hit enter and click on neutral and that's going to create a components. Json file for you next you should also see a Libs folder and it looks like it's set it up for us so awesome then you want to copy this second command paste it down here but you want to remove the word button and hit enter next click on a click enter again and that's going to speed up the process by installing all components for us so we don't have to go back and forth essentially and you should see the components folder right here great job now the first thing you're going to notice is if you click on the components. Json you'll notice that the Tailwind CSS file does not exist or not Tailwind CSS sorry it's the Tailwind config file and I think the reason is because of how shatan does this with the app router um not saying that the source router is the best option it doesn't really matter it honestly doesn't even like doesn't change anything but I noticed that the file wasn't created here so what you're going to do is create a new file and you want to call this Tailwind doc config do typescript and make sure it's the correct spelling of course and then once you're done with that if you go to the Discord you're going to find the asset file called Tailwind config typescript or JS just copy that and paste it in here okay and this is essentially going to help us export all of our colors set up the taable in configuration for our application now a very important thing is you'll notice we aren't passing that in here because it looks like shatan didn't do it for us and so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to copy the location the path of this and we're going to paste it into our component Json file so go ahead and type the following so we're going to say Tailwind config do typescript just like this and it's going to find it for us in the root directory great job now let's go ahead and cancel everything from here and let's also make sure we have our Global CSS awesome it looks like all the styles are placed in here as well and they look like chatsi and colors so this this this pretty much should be good to go so now let's close this file and let's go into our layout. TSX and the first thing we're going to do is set up the font like I mentioned so let's go ahead and grab this specific font so first thing is I'm going to remove this and let's remove this from here as well and the font is called dmore unor Mono okay so I made a spelling error just like this let's copy that and then down here I'm going to say const DM mono equal to this invoke it and for the settings we're going to pass the following so we're going to say wait actually not 700 I'm just going to set this to a string of 400 and subsets you can set it to Latin like this okay awesome and make sure there is a comma at the end and there we go now let's copy this let's go down here and let's remove everything from this class name and we want to say damono docl class name like this okay and that should add our styling to this component next you want to also put the suppress hydration warning so I'm going to pass that in here as well and we should be good to continue now next let's go up here and I'm just going to change this to easy clone and for description we just want to say fake easy website this is just for learning purpose okay awesome and then let's go down in here and we're going to hit enter and now we can put our providers our components whatever we need for shaten or our application sell inside this component so since this is a shorter video I'm going to have a lot of time to explain stuff uh but I'm not going to get into too much detail in the sense that I'm not going to explain things that i' expect you to already know and if you want to learn more in-depth on specific topics I'm definitely going to refer other videos that I've created in the past so the first one is a context which is a provider that we're going to create for our application now if you don't know what state management means then I highly highly recommend you watch the video plura which is one of my favorite and my best courses completely for free on YouTube and that will teach you how to create State Management from scratch and if you want to learn how to use a thirdparty library like zo stand or Redux there's a ton of other courses I've done completely for free on YouTube where you can learn okay but for now we are going to focus on just creating a car provider so we can give some um State Management in our application what is State Management well we're essentially creating a data layer around our application so think about it as this being our app and all we're doing is creating a data layer across the app so that individual components within the application nested or outside or basically in its own structure can access this data layer and then they can get access to the data from any nested structure this way we don't have to pass them down as props into these components on I think this is a known a known topic but I I don't want to get too much in detail but just in case you're wondering what we're doing that's what we're building right now but why do we have to build this well in our application we're going to need to maintain the state of our cart that means how many items did we add to the cart um the quantity the price point including the subtotal and this way we can use that at checkout you can also control other states like close and open for the cart itself and so you see how the state management is going to come in handy right even if we navigate to a different page we can essentially hold a state to render that state on the page so that's what we're going to do first so let's go ahead and build the car provider so first thing I'm going to say is car provider and we have to pass in the children components into this so let's go ahead and do that as well and I'm also going to say Bun Run Dev and refresh the browser all right so while that's refreshing let's go ahead and quickly complete the car provider so open up your folder structure and you want to create a folder in here so I'm going to shrink all of this and outside in the root folder I'm going to create another folder called providers and inside that I'm going to create a file called cart context you can also call this context but typically you'd see it called providers okay and now inside this I'm going to use tsrce and just create a card provider in here which I can export and I'm also going to import it from here if you don't know how I imported this I just used tsrce which is a um kind of like a plugin you can install it's called react Snippets and that's going to help you do that let's make sure our browser is up and running looks like I'm on https sorry about that and that's another topic that I covered in another video so if you want to learn how to do local development but on https you can take a look at one of my previous courses I think I'll leave a link somewhere on the page or uh I think it's actually called fuzzy it's the automation Builder video okay we built a lot on this channel so I totally lost track of it but I think it's fuzzy that video should teach you how to do that so inside this first we're going to create States and these states are going to be passed down into the context provider which will give that provider which will give data to all of the other comp components okay so first state is the items itself inside the card so I'm going to say const items set items equal to use State and let's invoke that and the type here is going to be an array of course but what type of an array well it's going to be a special type called cart item let's copy this type name and we're going to say type up top here or actually let's use interface cart item and this is going to have ID which is going to be a string name which is going to be a string price um what's this okay there we go price which is a number we're going to have quantity which is a number and we're also going to have images or yeah images like this and this is going to be an object um array of objects and we're going to have source so SRC which is going to be a string okay this is all we need for now we'll add more if we need in the future and now let's copy this paste it here but this has to be an array of these so let's go ahead and bring that in as well now the first thing is we see this error the reason why we see this error is we are using a client hook which is UST state which is only supposed to work on the client side inside this component and there's no way to indicate that this component or this page is a client component and so the way to do that is say use client up top and now let's refresh this and there we go now the next state is I'm going to have an open and set is open state so I know if the cart is open or not so I'm going to say const is open set is open equal to UST State and in here I'm going to say false for the default value now inside our components we also have props in here so I'm going to grab the children which is going to be react. react node and we can destructure those from here and then we can render it in here just like this so now you can see our root page is being rendered out great job now after this we're going to return our card provider here which is essentially the context provider and so instead of a div I'm going to remove this so let's just remove this whole line and I'm going to say cart context. provider now of course we don't have this provider already uh the context already and so that's the next thing that we need to create so what is a context the context is essentially what gives us access to a provider that we can use to wrap our components with to give those components access to the value that is stored inside this provider like such okay so let's go ahead and create that content so you want to scroll up here and in order to create a context you have to say create context so we're going to say cart cart context equal create context from react let's invoke that and for now I'm just going to pass in undefined and I'll tell you why you're not supposed to do this but I'm just essentially showing you the fastest way to build this right we're not going to focus on good coding practices but I'm just going to guide you along the way as well so essentially this context right here is going to have this value stored as the default value when it spins up so the cart data is going to be instead of you know a specific type of data structure you want for your app for now I'm just going to set it to undefined but if you have something you want to render by default when the app starts you will have to create const default value and you would have to set that default value in here but just for Simplicity of this video I'm going to put it to undefined now this is also going to have a type and the type here is card context type and so think about it this way the data layer that you use to wrap your entire application will have a type this way in other parts in your application you can get access to type intelligence that tells you what values what data or what methods do you have access to from the store so you can reuse them inside your code or get get values get data use Setters manipulate the state all that kind of stuff and so in order to do this we have to create a type here so it's easier to get that intelligence so I'm going to say interface card context type and first we're going to have the item State and the item state is going to be of this type card item but an array of them and then we're going to have another state called add item and this is going to be an arrow function that returns void but it's going to require the product and for now I'm just going to set it to any but you might have an object with a specific type so you can create a type for that as well the next one is remove item which is going to be another arrow function that returns void and this ID to give it more context is product ID okay and that's going to be a string next we're going to have update quantity which is going to be an array uh sorry it's an arrow function that gets the product ID which is a string and the quantity which is a number and it's a u function that returns void next we're going to have clear cart which is void is open which is a Boolean set is open which is a Setter to change this value which is an aror function that takes in a Boolean value and returns void and the cart total so we don't need on close we're going to get cart total which is going to be a number and so now we can reuse this in here or set it to undefined okay there we go so now we can use this state inside this you see it's already throwing some errors right so let's go ahead and grab that so the first thing we have to do is I'm going to say value equal to and we have the items so I'm going to pass in the items but it requires all the others as well right you see it requires U the add item remove item and all this kind of stuff and so the first thing we're going to do is create the add item value which is the function so we can pass that down in here and then we can access that in other parts of our application so I'm going to say const add item equal to use call back we're going to invoke this which is an arrow function and this is going to take an empty dependency array now why am I using use callback I'm not going to get into too much details but if this was just an arrow function it's going to invoke every time well used callback is going to cach the value as long as the dependency array never changes and so that's why it's better to do it this way okay it's not required but again just nicer ways to improve the performance of your code so next thing is when we invoke the add items function the first thing we want to do is we're going to be setting the items to something else right so let's invoke that first of all and this is going to give us access to the previous items in here and so I'm going to grab those as well and inside the code I'm going to do the following so the first step is to get the existing item because right here we're trying to add an item to the card but if the item already exists this then all we have to do is update the quantity so what I'm going to do here first is I'm going to say const existing item is equal to previous items. find for that item where item. ID is equal to the product. ID now product. ID comes from here so let's grab product dot um sorry it's product so product is of type any and let's bring that in right here okay looks like something is wrong okay because we have to return some data right so we're going to set this in here and then after this we're going to say if existing item then we're going to return the previous Items Map and I'm going to grab the item in here and I'm going to return if the item. ID is equal to the product. ID do ID like this then I'm going to return the following so I'm going to say question mark or do something here let's do something here for this section I'm going to return a new object for that data with everything inside the item but I'm going to set its quantity let me make sure I'm not making a spelling error here so quantity and I want to set that to item. quantity + one because it already exists in the card if not I'm going to return the item itself awesome now after this hit enter and by default we're going to return everything inside previous items but we're going to return a new object with everything inside the product and quantity is going to be set to one now down here finally we're going to set is open to true and there we go awesome great job so now we can copy this function and we can say add item like this and pass it down in here and so our components can essentially get access to all of the stuff so I see another eror here and the reason is because this is mentioned as though it is a function so let's change this to an object okay awesome and the next one is the remove items function so I want you to try to take this up as a challenge create a helper function called remove item and what this does is when you pass in a product ID it's going to look into the array and remove that product specific specifically that the user was trying to remove and set the new items to the one without that product so pause this video and take it up as a challenge if you don't know how to do it I'm going to show you exactly how to do it all right welcome back hopefully you got the right answer if not this is all you have to do so you're going to say use call back we're going to say product ID and this is a string we're going to set the items and in here we're going to say previous items CU we're going to grab that but we're going to filter them out where the item. ID is not equal to product ID okay and now we can copy this and paste it in here so if you did this great job to you now the next one is the update quantity so this is a little more challenging so I'd like you to take this one up as a challenge as well so create a helper function called update quantity that's essentially going to take in the product ID and the okay we need to pass in a dependency array and it's going to tell you to pass remove item do not do that okay so I'm going to say set items and in here we're going to get access to the previous items and then we're going to say previous items. map and we're going to return new data here by saying previous items. map if item. ID is equal to product ID then we're going to return everything inside the item but we're going to set the quantity that the user wants if not we'll just return the item itself that's it awesome so if you did this great job you are actually a developer so you're probably here just looking to improve on your code or just looking to learn how to use WordPress as a backend okay so the next thing now is we need to create the clear cart functionality so this is very straightforward so I'm going to do this as well so this is going to be const clear cart clear cart equal to use call back like this and we're going to set items to an empty array and you can also set is open defaults if you'd like but uh I'm just going to keep it like this now let's copy this and let's pass the clear cart in here awesome the next one is is open which we already have a state four so I'm going to copy is open and I'm going to paste is open in here and finally we need uh sorry two more things which is set is open which is going to be a call back sorry a Setter function and then finally the cart total now to do this we're going to need to copy this value go up here and we're going to say const car total equal items. reduce okay if you don't know what redu is you have a lot to learn in JavaScript but um that's fine no worries all we're going to do is reduce an array to a single value and the starting value the starting value for that is going to be zero and we're going to append to it so we're going to say give me access to total and the item and what we're going to return is total which is this essentially right zero Zer is a value of total plus item price um why is it not showing item. price like this and star item. quantity so item. quantity okay awesome so that's going to give us the car total let's copy that and paste it down here and finally we have to return the children items so let's go ahead and say children just like this great job so now you have created a provider that you can use in your application but we're going to need one more thing in order to use this you will need to get access to the context and so for that I'm going to create a hook so I'll go into my hooks folder and I'm going to create something called use cart. typescript and in here I'm going to export an arrow function or a regular function so I'm going to say function like this and this is called use cart hook and I also going to need to change this to use client even though I don't think I well I'm just going to do it just in case and then down here this is not going to need any params but all we're going to return in here is first the context which is use context and we're going to invoke this but we need to pass in the context from here so let's go ahead and grab the card context so so export and then we're going to need to import this inside a use card hook so pass in the context itself card context from providers great job and then now we're going to say if the context is equal to undefined then we're going to return or or actually throw new error like this okay and we don't need to do else here this is fine so throw a new error saying the use card hook should be used inside the card provider only this is just for a developer experience it's a standard procedure so you're going to need to do that and down here let's scroll down I see some errors okay this is any and this is any error okay that's fine so there we go now we have the hook we can use this C provider as well and inside your layout component in here you should have no errors great job now if you refresh the page you should also see the landing page which is page. TSX which is the next thing that we're going to work on so go into the page. TSX I'm going to shrink everything from here remove this just like this and what seems to be the error okay that's just because we're not returning anything so I'm just going to return a div for now and the next thing we need to do here is first we're going to need to render the products if you look at our designs the root page is going to have all of the products okay and so in order to do this we're going to need to create a server action so I'm going to say cons products equal A8 and because we're using 8 this will have to be an async function and I'm going to call This Server action get products copy this name go into your folder structure just shrink everything right here create a new folder and call it actions and inside that you want to create another server U server action file and you want to call it products so I'm going to say products. typescript and then first thing is you need to set it to use server for it to become a server action file and now we're going to need a library called wo Commerce rest typescript API and this library is essentially going to help us use woocommerce inside our nextjs application now inside this course I'm going to show you how to build the cart build all the woocommerce features pretty much from scratch to some extent using stripe but you can leverage this library in combination with other woocommerce libraries to literally do all of the heavy lifting that means you can reuse your components reuse their cart all that kind of stuff so you don't have to waste any time but in this course at least I want to give you some value as to how to build that and so I'm going to show you how to build your card from scratch how to do an add to card feature just do something as simple as possible nothing too complex and you can add on top of it okay but what I'm going to do first is quit the terminal and I'm going to say bun add woocommerce rest- typescript API and the version number that I'm using is also going to be inside the uh inside the Discord under the assets folder so just make sure you use the same versions as well okay so go ahead and hit enter and that should install that library for us now I'm going to import woocommerce rest API from woocommerce like this and now I'm going to create a client so I'm going to say const woocommerce equal to new woocommerce API like this and this is going to have an object where we can pass in all of the properties so the first one is we need to pass in the URL now the URL is something you can get from here so click on visit store like this visit store and that's going to take you to your store URL copy the URL and paste it in here okay and this has to be a string of course so please put it in a string okay the next one is the consumer key and this consumer key comes from variables so I'm going to say process. env. ucommerce consumer key like this as string and then the next one is for the consumer secret so I'm going to bring that in as well and then for version we're going to set it to woocommerce V3 okay so please type this in as well and then once we're done with this we can now create our get products function so I'm going to say export const function or export cons get products equal to an arrow function like this and that's going to return actually not this here is we're going to say cons products equal A8 woocommerce like this and because we're using a we I'm going to change this to an async arrow function doget we're going to invoke it and we're going to pass in what we passed in here so if you go into dashboard you go into woocommerce settings Advanced rest API this word right here right so products like this and then we're going to I mean you can set any stuff you want in here like how much you want per page the count but we don't need any data for now and then we're going to say return products. data great job now we can copy this go in here paste it and import get products and that's going to essentially get us all the products that we need for our application now let's go back to our lining page and let's refresh this let's make sure we do Bun Run Dev and let's refresh the browser now continuing the first thing we're going to create is our product grid so this is a grid structure that's essentially going to have everything in our application so I'm going to say product grid like this and I'm going to make it a closing component and then this is going to take in the products as a prop so let's go ahead and pass that in now you want to copy this name and you're going to open up your folder structure and inside your components folder you're going to create another file and you're going to call it product grid. TSX and then in here I'm going to use the tsrc snippet and rename it to product grid now let's go back and import this component and now you shouldn't have any errors okay so inside this component the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to get access to the product so I'm going to say product is going to be of type products I'm sorry it's going to be of type any array and let's bring that in right here as well okay now inside this we're going to first create a state to toggle our um our sidebar right sorry not our sidebar guys this right here so when you click on this you see we're toggling this right so I'm just going to create that to make it look nicer so I'm going to say const toggle and set toggle like this okay there we go and I'm going to use UST State and set it defaults by default and now let's go down here and because we're actually because we're using use State let's change this to use client and then down here I'm going to remove this and I'm going to set a class name of minimum height of screen and BG of white and then inside this I'm going to have the header which is a nav bar so I'm going to create a header component with the following Styles please pause and type the Styles and then we're going to have a div inside this to essentially hold this like a container so I'm going to say container with the following Styles as well and in here we're going to have a button so I'm going to say button and this is going to have a class name padding of two and then we're going to have an onclick inside this and this on click is going to be an arrow function that's ENT essentially going to set toggle like this to the opposite of toggle looks like I have some other errors in here what seems to be the issue okay there we go now in here I'm going to check if toggle is true if so I'll return something here or I'll return something else now for the if success block I'm going to return an X component from Lucid react and this is going to have a class name of height set to six width set to six and font set to bold and if it's not true then we're going to have a more vertical option like this right so you can toggle that through so I'm going to say more vertical like this with the class name height six and width six and now you should see that right here so if I click it you see it's toggling on and off okay and now after this I'm going to have a span and inside the span I'm going to have a class name and we're going to set this to Sr only and inside this I'm going to say menu so now when I click on it um actually we're not going to see anything cuz we're using this uh let me just quick search why I use this class okay we don't need this um I think this was unnecessary let's remove this or why do we have uh why did I put this here so use Sr only to hide an element visually without hiding it from the screen reader cool okay fine so I think that's why I mentioned it that's totally fine it's not very important um but we can have that just as a way to I guess give more info for this button right so right now X and more ver verticle has no meaning and so this is going to give a screen reader more meaning that's why okay so it's for a screen reader only now down here after this button we're going to say toggle if this is true then we're going to return a div so I'm going to say div like this and I'm going to remove this menu and I'm going to set the following class names U so go ahead and set the following Styles so pause the screen and please type this and then inside this we're going to essentially create a um like an array that has all of these values so we can Loop over them okay so go ahead and open up your fold structure just go into Libs create another file call it data. typescript and in here I'm just going to paste this from the Discord so go to the Discord and grab the assets folder so you can essentially just uh copy paste these in here okay it's just the pages with the slash routes so the pages U and the hre essentially and then in here we can render those out so I'm going to Loop over this now and I'm going to say navbar data do map and for each of them we're going to get access to the item but in here we're going to return a link component from next link and we're going to set the href to be the item. link we're going to set the key to be the item. name and uh not name sorry do index like this and then we have the class name so I'm just going to put some styles on this as well so please go ahead pause this and type The Styling and then inside this I'm going to have the items title so I'm going to say item title why is it not giving me that item. tile okay there we go now after this down here so if you click on this now um you should see it okay looks like something is wrong guys just give me one second okay so nothing was wrong I don't know what was going on I think it's just that I had to refresh the server so now we're good to go now let's go ahead shrink this so you can see clearly so command B command J and after this down here we're going to hit enter after the div wait 1 2 3 hit enter here okay and we're going to use a sheet component from UI sheet so let's bring that in this is going to have the open State and the is open set on that now where do we get this from this comes from our used cart hook so go ahead and say const like this this and we're going to set this to use cart and let's invoke this and then from the use cart hook we're going to destructure is open and set is open now let's go down here and I'm going to set those values on the sheet component so I'm going to say open equal to is open and on open change is set is open next the sheet is going to need a trigger right so the trigger is going to say uh your cart essentially so let's go ahead and say sheet trigger like this and we're going to set this to as child and in here we're going to create a button element with text Dash actually let me copy this so I don't make unnecessary errors please pause and type The Styling and then inside this we're going to have a span that says cart just like this then after this cart down here we're going to say cart items and where do we get the card items from well this also comes from our state our used card state right our hook so first this is called items but I'm going to rename it to cart items like this and let's scroll down here and now we can say cart items and give me one second okay so I'm supposed to reduce this I'm going to say dot uh do length first not redu guys sorry I'm supposed to check the length first and make sure it's greater than zero and uh if it is greater than zero then we're going to return a span like this oh why is there so much on my screen okay span like that and this span is going to have the following styling so I'm just going to copy this CSS code and then inside the span I'm going to essentially reduce the cart items to a total quantity right so I'm going to say cart items. reduce invoke that and I'm going to say total this is going to be total SL item and this is going to be an arrow function and let me see if I can grab that from the [Applause] AI okay there we go so it gave it to me so total plus item quantity and we're going to put zero down here okay now you want to scroll down here after the trigger and so now you see you see the word cart right so nice now after this we're going to have the content that has to render and so for Content I'm going to use a sheet content component let's bring that in from shat Andi and then inside this I'm also going to have some class names but now we have to have the header component which is very straightforward sheet header with sheet title saying your cart okay and now if I click on it you're going to see the card show up on the page okay nice awesome now after this inside after the header we're going to essentially render out all of the card items so card items. length if this is equal to zero then we're going to do something in here or we'll do something here now if it is equal to zero I'm going to render out a placeholder to just show that there's no items in the cart so I'm going to have a styling some class names for that as well so please go ahead and type that out and after this uh what's what's this let's uh okay there we go pH that was so annoying now in here I'm going to have a shopping cart icon so I'm going to say shopping cart like this and that's going to have some styling as well so let's grab that as well okay just like this and then after that we're going to have a paragraph that says your cart is empty so if I click on it right now I'm going to see your cart is empty okay nice and after this I'm going to also scroll down after the shopping cart okay so I see margin bottom of four and when I look at this huh okay so this should be fine if I put something in here what happens okay you see there's no padding okay we'll figure that out later so now down here I'm going to return a div like this and this div is going to have the following class name it's just a container and if you're wondering what we're building in here this is going to look somewhat like this okay so we're going to have uh list items to render out all of the card items so we'll have an image um its quantity and I mean sorry its name and the price so let's go ahead and do that and so inside this we're going to have another div to kind of contain all of this and so we're going to say div with the following class names and then we're going to have a an unordered list to render out those items and this is going to have space y of six and inside this I'm going to say card items. map for the item and we're going to essentially render out a list item with a key let me go to this with a key like this okay and then I see an eror here let's render this out the right way what's going on so we have two brackets huh okay let me me fix this guys okay there we go it was just a bracket problem so I'm going to say list item with the following key and I'm going to set the class name to the following as well okay and now inside this I'm going to create a div and this div is going to have the following class names and this is going to hold are um essentially the images uh the image itself and so that's why we're going to have the uh overflow hidden on this and we're going to use the next image right here just like this image and import it from next image and then first the source is going to be Source item do like this items. images at 0. source /lh holder. SBG okay and then after that I'm going to have the alt Tags I'm going to say alt I'm going to have width set to 96 and height set to 96 as well and the class is going to be height full width full object not cover object contain so let's say contain and padding of two okay and after this we're going to um have the price at the bottom here okay now after this div hit enter we're going to create another div and this is going to have Flex Flex one and flex column like this and inside this div we're going to have another div that's essentially going to hold the item and the price value so I'm going to say div with the following class name H3 for item name and the paragraph for the item price now of course you're not going to see any data in here because we can't click on any of the grids cuz we haven't built them yet yet what we're building right now is just the cart but once we have the items in here I'm pretty sure you can just look at it's a very simple structure you have image you have name and price right so just keep that in mind we're building something that looks similar to this now after this we're going to hit enter after this div uh actually this one not this right here and I'm going to create another div and this is going to have Flex items Center and margin top of two and side the S I'm going to create a button and this button is going to help us update the quantity um by reducing it by one and also increasing it by one so we're essentially having the way to having a wait for the customer to add more quantity so first I'm going to have class name and the following styles are going to be added so just give me one second just like this rounded and border with padding of one and I'm also going to have the update quantity and this comes from our hook so let's go up to top and let's bring that in right here so update quantity and I'm going to scroll down here and now inside my button component I can essentially use this so I'm going to say update quantity I'm sorry on click equal to an arrow function that says update quantity and it passes in the item ID and the item quantity minus one okay and looks like it did this twice so let's remove that there we go nice now inside the button we're going to need to have a minus icon and this is going to have class name height of four and width of four okay awesome now after this I have to show the quantity itself right so I'm going to create a span with the class name set to the following Styles and inside the span I'm going to say item quantity just like this then I'm going to copy this button up here actually I made a small error guys so this span has to be after the button and yes like I said copy the button and we're going to paste instead after this but we're going to change this from minus1 to + 1 and for this here I'm going to change this to plus icon and we should be all set okay awesome and then after that we're going to have another button so we can remove this from the cart so take this up as a challenge I showed you how to build every single thing so far uh that helps you remove the Quant I'm sorry add increment the quantity and uh remove one but we also want to have a button that invokes a remove from cart function from our hook and removes the item from the cart so create a button down here right after this button and give it the ability to remove that item from our cart all the best okay awesome hopefully you got it if not this is how you do it very straightforward you got to have a button and we're going to use the remove from cart which is essentially the remove cart but just renamed so you want to scroll up top it's called remove items sorry so remove items but we're going to rename it to remove from cart okay and then down here we're going to pass in the item ID and we're going to also have the following class name on this and then we're going to have an x button and uh the word remove next to it so we know that we can remove the element by clicking that button and that's pretty much we're all set for this now down here you're going to find a curly bracket after that UL after that div hit enter and then create the following div and then we're going to give it give it the following Styles inside this we're going to essentially render out the subtotal and the cart something like this right the cart total so I'm going to create another div to kind of hold that like a container and then use justify between to put this on the left and this on the right so I'm going to create the container justify between and the following Styles and then I'm going to say subtotal and card total in a paragraph and now let's also go ahead and grab the cart total from our hook so right up here I'm going to say car total and now I can render it down right here so I see these errors here and that's because uh yes we're not looping over products yet to create the grid that's that's the reason why so let's take a look at our cart make sure we're almost done okay and right here after this div hit enter and you're going to create a component called checkout which is work in progress so go ahead and say work in progress like this okay we'll get to this in just a second now let's go ahead and test this functionality and for that we're going to need to create the product grid so after the header hit enter you're going to create a main tag and you're going to set the following class names on this main tag and then inside that you're going to have a div that has the grid layout as follows so from mobile devices it's going to be one so that means only one column from small devices it's going to be two and from medium devices three and everything above the large device it's going to be four only okay and everything is also capped inside a container so it's not going to expand further next we're going to have gap of 40 between those so it kind of looks similar to this now inside this we're going to Loop over our products so I'm going to say products. map and we're going to get the product itself and the index and this is going to return a link component and inside here I'm going to pass in the hre which is essentially going to be a string so we're going to use back ticks SL product and we're going to pass in the product ID and then after this we're going to have a key I'm going to just set it to index for now and then some class names on this link as well and now if you put put something in here you'll see it's returning one element right that's because we have one product now inside this div I'm going to create a div inside the link sorry and I'm going to create another div and I'm going to give it the following Styles because this is going to hold our image right so I'm going to say div like this and with the following class names and then inside here I'm going to create an image component from next image and this image component is going to have the source attribute so I'm going to say source is equal to and this is going to be what we're getting from this product so I'm going to say product. images z. source and then I'm going to say placeholder.svg now you're going to see this error and the reason is because we don't have a config next config typescript option here that allows this property to show okay that allows this uh domain to essentially show so it's going to show error for us okay and so we have to essentially give it act uh give it access so that we can access the image so this is actually actually this is not the error that I expected this is because we don't have height and width so first let's set that so I can show you what that error looks like so I'm going to say alt width and height just like this alt width height and now you'll see that error okay there we go and so we need to essentially assign this inside our codebase inside our next config file so this domain or this host name is essentially verify to render out images inside our application and so before I do that I'm also going to give this image a class Name by setting with full height full and object contain and now let's go ahead and fix this error all right so remember that error I was I was talking about right the reason why we're seeing that errors because we need to configure that endpoint in here now you might have a next config MJS file okay and if you have that it should be okay um you don't really need to do anything crazy but um you will also find that version inside the Discord inside the assets file okay if you have a TS file all you have to do is copy the configuration from that file and paste it in here okay so um this is all you have to type on this page which is the next config typescript and then make sure you quit your terminal and you spin up the terminal again and that should solve this problem for you okay that means that error will be removed permanently so it's just that they want you to verify the domain in here but I think if you add this and I guess these experimental hooks I think it removes that stuff okay so now let's go back to our code right here and after the image uh let's make sure we also have the price and the name so this is the overlay that we need to create so first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a div like this with the following Styles and inside that I'm going to create another div with the following sides Styles as well and then I'm going to have the product name and the product price and so this is going to use justify between to be left side and right side there you go just like that so this is what it looks like on mobile and this is what it looks like on desktop right looks awesome so now let's quit this let's click on cart now we don't have anything in here and now the the way we're going to add something to cart is uh let's go into our figma file and so when you click on this it's going to take you in here and when you click on one of these just for Simplicity sake we can use this as a way to add the number of quantity okay but you might want to use this as a gallery and that's totally fine that just makes more sense right so if you're using a gallery image inside WordPress you can render out the gallery image right in here so this is super super powerful it's like a free CMS tool right right so let's go in here and now I'm going to close this page let me also check and make sure all errors are solved okay it's just this and you can actually do at typescript ignore or maybe you can't do it in here maybe do it up here okay never mind so I'm going to close this file and now that we're done with this file when we click on this it's going to take us to SL product/ product ID but we're we're going to see a 404 and the reason is because we don't have that page setup so create a product page like this and you want to hit enter and inside that you want to create a dynamic route called ID and inside that a page. TSX why is it not letting me create there we go page. TSX and now inside this component I'm going to render out the product page like this so TSR fce and just change the titles okay now this is going to give us access to prams so let's grab that and this is going to give us the ID which is going to be a string and then down here I can essentially grab PMs and I can also destructure it to grab the ID now I can print the ID in here so I can say ID and I should see 61 awesome now first one I want to do is first thing I want to do is get the info of the product that's how we can render the product information right this is the product Details page so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create another arrow function here another server action called get product so product equal A8 let's change this to async and I'm going to say get product and I'm going to pass in the ID and this is get product a new server action so copy this open up your folder structure go into products. typescript and at the bottom I'm going to say export const get product is equal to an async function and this async function is going to need not slug I'm just going to call it ID and then in here we're going to say cons product equal woocommerce doget and instead of this part I'm actually going to remove this because there's a simpler way to do this I'm going to pass an an object and say parse int like this and I'm going to pass in the ID in here okay and then finally I'm going to return the product data now you can do a bunch of error handling if you'd like but um just for Simplicity sake to speed up the process I'm just going to do it this way so now I have the ID uh and the details of the product as well and so now we can render that product on the page so let's go in here and inside this the first thing we're going to have is a div so let's remove this here and I'm going to say div as follows with Min height screen and then inside this I'm going to have a container so that's going to be div container with margin X of Auto PX of four and py of six and now I'm going to have a back button up top so I'm going to say link which comes from next link so link next link like this and HF is going to be backs slash like this and then after that I'm going to have some styling on that as well so let's go ahead and pass it in and then inside this link I'm just going to say back okay there we go if you click that it's going to take us back to the root page now in here after this link I am going to actually yeah let's just scroll down after this link and create another div and this div is going to have the following class names so let's go ahead and paste that in here and inside this div I'm going to essentially render out the product image so this is going to use grid and so I'm going to create two columns here so I'm going to say large column span two Flex Flex column and gap of six and inside this I'm going to render out all the product images okay so I'm going to say but for now I mean I'm just going to use one image but you could use multiple and that's why I have this structure here right but our main reason why we need this grid structure here is that that we're going to essentially put this on the right side and this will stick to the right of right side of the page right and when you scroll down um this is going to essentially only scroll the left side now one more thing is on mobile devices we want this to be at the bottom and that's why we're using grid structure because it's so much easier to move things around so in here I'm going to say products um this should be product not products product. image images at z. Source if this exists then we're going to render out a div like this okay and inside this div I'm going to give it the following class names so let's go ahead and do that as well and inside this I'm going to render out that image component from next image okay and that's going to need the source and the alt tag so let's say source and ALT and then I need width and height which is going to be 600 and then after that I'm going to put a class name on it just like this and I'm going to set the property called priority on it okay and then after that down here you're going to hit enter after these curly brackets and now we can create the product details okay so first thing is create a div and this div is going to be Flex Flex column and gap of four and inside this div I'm going to have another div that's going to contain the product name the product quantity and the product price so go ahead and create a div like this with the following class names and inside that NH H1 which is going to have text 2 XEL font bolt and I'm going to say product name and then after that I'm going to create another component called Product quantity okay and let's just put this under a work in progress flag so I'm going to say work in progress like this okay and then after that I'm going to create another div I'm going to say class name it will not give me class name okay there we go text to excel font dasb and in here I'm going to say dollar sign outside this product. price okay there we go great job and then after this div down here we're going to essentially render out the description that we have that is coming back from the backend okay now keep this in mind I do not recommend you do this in production please do not do this this way okay you have to essentially uh what we're doing here is we're rendering out the data coming from the description which is actually not not a paragraph not text it is HTML okay and so you should never set the HTML content of an element directly but I'm just doing it just for Simplicity sake but what I would recommend you do is you have to put um some security stuff on that okay you have to verify to ensure that the HTML is secure and it's safe to consume and only then should you append this or even simpler you can use the description short description page or short description option to just add text only in there okay so I'm going to do this only for now I'm warning you once more please do not do this error okay do not do this mistake so text Gray 700 and I'm going to set it's literally called dangerously set inner HTML okay and so we're going to set that to an object and we're going to say underscore HTML and remember anything with underscore is not supposed to be used right and so that's why it's done this way and so you're going to say underscore HTML like this product. description and now you can see everything is going to render down in here okay great job so let's remove this and just make this a closed div like this okay awesome and then let's scroll up here and let's do the product quantity first because we want to see the cart and make sure it's working so copy this component name and you're going to go into your components folder create another folder call it product and I'm going to say product quantity. TSX and let's use tsrce and render out the components next this prop is going to have product which is of type any and let's go ahead and destructure that value in here and now down in here all we're going to do is I'm just going to use an array of 10 elements and just Loop over them and render out a number okay so remove this in here and we're going to give this the following class names so I'm going to say class name like this okay and inside this I'm going to say dot dot dot array invoke it and we're going to pass in t 10 and then you want to say map and for each of these you're going to get an arrow function right so um I'm going to for each of these we're going to grab the index as well and in here I'm going to say span and this span is going to first have the key so let's that let's State the key and then some class names as well but before that let's just render out the element and now let's go back and quickly import the product quantity component so I'm going to say product quantity and I need to pass in the product itself so product equal product like this and now you can see I will see those elements in here right okay now let's go back into product quantity and then after this the class name uh is going to be as follows so I'm going to hit enter inside the span and I'm going to say class name which is going to check the product quantity and this comes from a value that we're going to create up here but before that we need all of this from our use card store our use card hook so because we've done this a million times I'm just going to paste the use card hook in here and first change this to a use client component and now I'm just going to import the things that I need okay and so in here to create the current product quantity I'm going to create a value so const equal current product sorry const current product current product quantity equal to card items. find and we're going to use an arrow function in here and I'm going to say give me the item itself but if the item. ID is equal to the product. ID if this is true then um we want um not if this is true sorry after this we're going to get the quantity if this exists so if this exists get quantity for me if not set it to zero okay and so now we can render that out in here another way you can do this is actually to optimize it even more you can use uh one of the not call back I think there's an use memo right use memo will store this value and pretty much um kind of cash the value and then you can pass in the cart items as a dependency array just to make sure this doesn't fire on every single Loop but even then this is not a very complex operation but if you're doing a very complex operation then make sure you put that in a used memo hook okay so down here finally we're going to need an onclick and the on click is going to essentially handle uh going to handle the updating of our state to add something to the cart okay so I'm going to say const handle product equal to an arrow function and let's copy this and down here I'm going to say onclick equal to an arrow function that takes an handle product and we're going to say I I + 1 okay I + one uh why is it throwing an error okay that's because I'm not expecting it in here so I'm going to say uh quantity is going to be a number okay awesome and then in here first I'm going to find the product from our card items so find and I'm going to say item like this and find it if the item. ID is equal to the product. ID and the reason is because if we found if we found the product I'm just going to update its quantity if not I'm going to add it to the card as a new product so I'm going to say if find product update quantity else add product and I'm going to pass in the product ID in here damn AI is so awesome man that just that just did it for me in a few seconds that's cool so now down here I also do not like this text being so huge let's remove this and let's see if that changes anything okay padding X of two all right much better so if you click on this let's say you clicked on one right um let's refresh the page and do that once more so we want to check here if it's equal to I + 1 this looks correct to me so if I click on this now let's just look at cart something looks off okay there we go so something was off actually huh cannot read properties of undefined reading zero okay so this is all right just give me one second guys all right guys so I found the issue here the reason why we were seeing that error was because we weren't writing the function to handle the click correctly so inside product quantity right here we were adding the wrong property to the cart so instead of sending the product itself we were sending product. ID and I figured that out because when I clicked on the element right here when I clicked on this it wasn't highlighting the the number of quantity itself it was just turning off and so that means something was wrong there and so I clicked on it and I saw okay so this add to card requires a product itself so that was the error and that's why we were seeing the undefined cannot read properties of undefined error inside this helper function okay so all you have to do was change that part and that should solve that error and I also changed some styling so let's go ahead and look at that so inside the product grid component down here I changed the cart items UL div right here this div I changed it from uh from padding bottom or padding top or something or padding y I'm not sure I changed it to padding six and at the bottom as well I changed this one to to padding six as well okay so just go ahead and do that and you should be all set so let's just test it out real quick so as you can see we have the space for the cart we'll put that there in just a second but if I click on any of the elements right now if I click on number two it highlights number two and if I go back to click on my cart I see number two in here and if I add more down here we should see it multiply awesome great job and just to make sure this is also working if I click on x button it removes it from the cart and great job so far now let's go ahead and proceed so I'm just going to shrink this and now let's go into our component itself because we have to render out the other card section and then we should be good to go okay so let's go in here and after this component after these two divs I'm going to hit enter create another div give it a class name of large column Das span-1 and in here I'm going to essentially create another component called Product action okay so go ahead and say the following as well and I'm going to copy this copy this name here open up my folder structure and inside my products folder in components I'm going to create a TSX file with that name and use the snippet to rename this component as well and then let's go back and quickly import the product action component now inside here the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to remove this and it's going to show at the bottom here right so I'm going to create a div and this div is going to have the following class names so let me go ahead and set that on this okay and it's going to create this gray space in here and if you look at it on desktop it's going to stick up here when you scroll okay and now inside this div create another div in here let's go ahead and say div and inside this we're going to have the cart header first okay and this is going to look very similar to something like this again okay so nothing too complex or too different from what we've built before so just go ahead hit enter and create another divon here with the following class names and this is going to have a three grid column structure okay and then after that we're going to have product as the first element Q as a quantity and price right here okay next after this hit enter and now we're going to have the cart items so I'm just going to create this tag here and what I'm going to do here is I'm going to Loop over the cart items and these cart items are going to come from our use cart hook so since we've done this already I'm just going to paste this in here import use cart go up top and change is to use client component and now I can use all of the things that I get from my use card hook in in here so I'm going to say card items. map and we're going to get each item here so what seems to be the issue right here let's see so let's get this up in one line okay and for the card item I'm going to essentially return a div like this and inside this div let's give it a a key and set that key to the item doid and then it's going to have a class name for some Styles so let's go ahead and give it some Styles as well and inside this div I'm going to have the name quantity and price for the for this item so if you see right here nothing's in here right now but if I add something to cart you're going to see the quantity show right here so if I change it to 2 3 4 10 it's going to reflect accordingly okay let's shrink the now and then after this div I'm going to hit enter after this one all the way at the actually not that one so we have this bracket we have this curly bracket here and another div okay hit enter after this and this is the subtotal section okay so in here I'm going to create another div give it margin top of Auto and inside this I'm going to essentially create another div that's going to have the following class names so go ahead and type these class names out and I'm I'm going to show subtotal so subtotal and I'm going to show the car total that's pretty much it so subtotal and car total um something changed where is this okay subtotal and car total right at the bottom here now it looks like something is off let me see what's going on guys okay so I made some errors here so I'm just going to change this to flex items Center justify between and that should fix that error and then then after this div I'm going to hit enter and I'm going to use another component called checkout which is a component we're going to need to essentially um check out a get a payment form essentially okay so let's go ahead and build that out so copy the checkout component title you want to open up your folder structure and inside components I'm going to create a checkout component. TSX and return Snippets right here and change the title and this component is going to have a button down here so let's create a div set the class names to margin top of six grid and gap of four and then down in here I'm going to have a button component from UI button and this button is going to have size large class name with full and then I'm going to create u a disabled prop that's essentially going to turn off the button when the user is not going to have the ability to buy this product or check out right now and that is only if we are loading the process that means if we're are making the payment right now or checking out and if course of course there's U you know items length is zero so there's nothing in the card so to do that I'm going to create a state actually not create a state I'm going to extract the state from use card hook and let's change this to use client and I'm going to get the items array right here and then I'm also going to create another state called loading and set loading and this is used for stripe when the user is trying to check out right so let's grab that and set it to fults by default and then down here I'm going to say disabled not directory I don't know why I did that so disabled loading and items. or if items. length is equal to zero then we'll disable the button okay and now let's go back and quickly import this checkout component right here okay there we go and you should see that at the bottom now we also have to provide some text in here so I'm going to say if it is loading then I'm going to say processing if not I'm going to say check out just like this there we go and now if I scroll refresh and scroll to the bottom I should see checkout but it's going to be disabled okay if I add a product to my cart then I will see the number shows and I can check out but if I click on it of course nothing's going to happen right now so let's go ahead and set that up so go ahead and hit enter and say onclick equal to on checkout which is a helper function and up here I'm going to say const on checkout equal to an arrow function and this Arrow function is essentially going to load stripe load the uh the checkout for this for a stripe checkout and it's going to help the customer essentially pay and in order to do this we're going to need a stripe package called at uh called stripe stripe JS okay so let's go ahead quit the terminal refresh the browser and I'm going to say bun ad at stripe dstrip JS and please please make sure to add the right version number and you can find that from the package Json inside the Discord Channel okay so in here first thing I need to do is import stripe load Stripe from stripe JS just like this and now down um right here I'm going to say const stripe promise equal to load stripe we're going to invoke that and we're going to pass in the process. environment variable called next stripe publishable key okay and this is not an object this is just a parameter so let's go ahead and pass that in and make sure you put the exclamation points now how do you get this value and that's exactly what we're going to do now so make sure you log into stripe and create an account if you haven't already and then go into your dashboard and you should see the test mode up here if you don't see test mode click on settings and toggle test mode on now stripe is a monster of a tool okay there's so many things that you can do with strip stripe and it's very very complex it has I mean quite frankly speaking I have spent hours months of my time just learning how to incorporate stripe uh into our applications right and so what I did was I went uh kind of like to a next step to create a very short quick link guide for you that you can grab from the web Prodigy store so just go to web Prodigy store and you will find a stripe quicklink guide that has links so that you don't have to read the documentation and if you want to just just create a stripe subscription you just click here and it's going to take you exactly to that documentation page because like I said stripe is a monster of a tool there's so many different type of documentation and it's just super super super affordable there's no crazy price point or anything I we're just looking to help you guys out right so I just created this and hopefully it helps you kind of navigate stripe but if not I'm also going to show you how to look through this in order to find all of your development Keys okay so the first thing you need is the public strike publish shible key which you should get inside the API key but you're not going to find it in here and that's why it's a little confusing so go to search and you have to look up U API Keys like this and you might see something like this if you see this page click on API keys and you're going to get all of the keys you need so go ahead copy these keys and paste it inside your environment variables and then once you're done we will proceed okay awesome I finished uh pasting the variables hopefully it as well if not please just copy and paste it right now okay so the next thing is in here I'm going to create the on checkout function and so the first one is to create a checkout session okay so I'm going to say const response equal await Fetch and I'm going to use back SL API SL checkout which is going to be another route we have to create and then the next thing is I'm going to create an object in here so we can pass in the properties so the method here is going to be post for headers I'm going to say content type application Json and for the body we're going to send in json. stringify and we're going to pass in all of the items in here okay then after this is done we're going to create a session so I'm going to say const session ID is I'm sorry we're going to destructure the session that comes back back from this so I'm going to say await response. Json and we're going to invoke this and then when that comes back down here first let me just change this to an asnc component and then down here I'm going to say stripe equal to await stripe promise and then after this I'm going to check if there's any errors so I'm going to say error equal to await stripe dot uh sorry like this stripe. redirect to checkout we're going to invoke that and pass in the session ID and then after that if there was any errors let's go ahead and see once more okay it's not giving me type Inon so I'm going to say error then in here we're going to throw new error error. message and then if not actually this is fine so down here I'm going to have a catch statement do we even have a TR catch okay looks like I didn't create the TR catch so let's go ahead and do that so what I'm going to do is I'm going to shrink all of this uh where did that go okay shrink the on checkout or sorry the response right here going to copy all of this and I'm going to create a try catch so try catch block and inside here I'm just going to paste this and then for the error I'm going to uh console log the error so error like this and then finally I'm going to do the following so I'm going to set loading to false and don't forget up here we also have to set loading to True okay all right that's pretty much it so if you go back here and let's say Bun Run Dev or Bun Run Dev hit enter and let's refresh this page okay and now I'm just going to add one to cart but if I click on this nothing's going to happen of course but I want to show you that it's actually processing this okay we're going to get no error here actually 44 or we're not going to get anything and so we have to go ahead and set you know that end point right so let's go ahead and do that so I also see something else in here which is unexpected error is not a valid Json object uh let me see what's that what's that error okay first let's go ahead and set up the endpoint so we can debug easily so I'm going to shrink everything inside app I'm going to create an API folder and inside that I'm going to create a checkout route just like I mentioned in here check out and inside that a route. typescript now inside this I'm going to create the a poost request so I'm going to say export uh export async Arrow fun function and I'm going to say post uh actually not Arrow function guys sorry about that it has to be an actual function so export async function and I'm going to change this to post and in here we're going to get request so let's change this to request and for type is going to be request like this and in here first I'm going to create a TR catch okay and then down here I'm going to extract the items so I'm going to say items from the body so await request. Json and let's invoke that and now we have these items in here and then all I'm going to do is I'm going to Loop over each item and I'm going to create a price with a quantity so we can enter this uh these inside the line items property inside the stripe body okay so I'm going to say const line items equal items. map which gives us an array in here and I'm going to get the item which is going to be of type any and then in here I'm going to return an object with price undor data so sorry I made a spelling err there okay it's price uncore data and I'm going to first put currency as USD the product data is going to be the item is going to be an object with name item name images item. image and then I'm going to have a unit amount okay and so this is going to be item price time time * 100 because stripe expects everything in sense and then after this I'm going to have the quantity so the quantity is going to be item. quantity in here now after this this is going to be an array of all of these values right so let me just confirm okay there we go and down here I'm going to create a session so equal a weight and this is going to be stripe but we don't have this so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to hit enter for this right now and and okay like this and let's go ahead and create the stripe client right here so I'm going to say export stripe equal new stripe and this stripe comes from another package called stripe so open up your your terminal going to quit the terminal refresh in here and I'm going to say bun add stripe and hit enter and then up top in here I'm going to essentially import Stripe from stripe just like this now okay awesome and now we can use that in here so I'm going to say export const stripe equal new stripe and this is going to need our stripe secret key first so I'm going to pass it in as a first uh first parameter and then uh first argument and then after that I'm going to have an object and I'm going to set the API version to be the following so please put the exact same version this is the latest API version okay now let's scroll down here for the set session and now you see the session here is going to be payment method types we're going to put card line items is going to be all the line items from here mode is payment but the success URL is going to be slightly different so I'm going to remove this from here and I'm going to say process. EnV env. nextt publ site URL okay so let's go ahead and say the following just like this but we're going to say slash so success question mark um something looks wrong okay it's after this guys so slash success question mark uh session ID equal to checkout session ID like this and then the cancellation URL is going to be the same as this one right here which is the process.env next public public site URL okay then we're going to resp respond back with next response and I'm going to invoke uh Json and I'm going to pass in the session ID as the session. ID okay and if there was an error I'm going to console.log the error on the server and I'm also going to return next response and I'm going to say Json error creating checkout session and status of 500 now let's go ahead and open up our terminal say bun runev and let's refresh our browser all right now now is the moment of truth if everything looks good and stripe is set up correctly we should not get that error right because the only reason why we're getting that error is because we're not getting any response back from here so now this should definitely 100% sort sort out this error for us so I'm going to click on number one to add one product of this and when I hit continue There we go now we see the checkout page great job the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to search for my work in progress flags and I'm also going to bring in the checkout component inside the product grid component page okay so let's bring in this component in here and let's refresh this so let's just take a look at the cart so let's add something to the cart all right there we go great job now I want you to take this up as a challenge here is your task you need to create a buy now button so this is something you will see in Amazon they do this a lot which is instead of giving the user the ability to add it to the card and then have them buy the product instead in said we should have a button where the user can directly buy the product itself okay so if I want this I can just click on buy now instead of checkout and that should instantly fire off stripe that should send an API request and should also send the user to that specific checkout page okay so just for now I'm going to give this a shot using the cart so let's go back here inside our cart I'm going to add about $2,300 worth of flipflop slides whatever and then click on checkout and awesome we see the exact same amount and we see the quantity as well and now let's go ahead and put in some fake credit card information okay I'm going to go ahead and click on checkout and this should work as expected awesome now it is sending us back to the success route so that's another challenge for you so you're going to need to create a route called success okay and this route should basically have a thank you page that will show up when the user is done checking out just showing them that they have succeeded uh you know making the payment the payment went through and maybe you can show some product you know details on the page as well all right great job so far now let's move on to the more important part of our application which is helping it scale to millions and millions of users and at the same time getting a reliable hosting that is Affordable and how we can take this to the next level all right so now that we have our e-commerce store ready to go this is the most important part which is making this production grade so we can host it the right way now this is the most important step because we have to make it Enterprise grade because we want our application to expand and scale to millions of concurrent users on the application or on your e-commerce store and let's be honest when it comes to hosting there are hundreds of different hosting providers it is very complicated and annoying to analyze each and every single one of them to see you know which is the best fit and so hopefully this video can show you exactly what you need to consider what you need to look for when you're getting hosting you are either an e-commerce business owner or you have an e-commerce store right or more importantly I I mean I think most of you guys are developers right so you're probably a developer and you probably have clients that are looking for scalable you know solutions that can grow with them in the future or maybe something that is high traffic right so maybe a learning management system or blog post that kind of stuff um and that's probably why you're looking for something like this and hopefully I help answer all those questions in here so when it comes to hosting the first thing you want to look for in hosting is speed if your hosting provider does not give you access to plugins and light speed plugins Etc then it's it's going to be a pain to deal with and you're going to need to do it all manually and I would honestly not suggest you do that so make sure that your hosting provider is you know has a good word out there when it comes to speed and deliverability for millions of users so if your hosting provider is using a combin of some cuttingedge technologies like light speed Enterprise then I think it's a good way to consider them okay so I'm going to add this in here as well next is scalability I think this goes without saying if you're building something for your clients you're building a site for your client and they need something that's high traffic then your hosting provider should give you the ability to scale to millions of users and usually if it's just a static website hosting service then you're probably not going to get any of these features so please please take a look at all of this next one is security so if your website needs millions of concurrent users it probably also means that you're going to experience DS attack sometime in the future okay it happens it's just it's just part of business you just have to have the infrastructure in place to deal with all of this so that you don't get a crazy bill or you know you don't have to deal with a crazy downtime right so if uh I mean if you don't know what dos is it's basically when a hacker tries to bring down one of your services by burning out that service right and so they can send things they can call your API I mean there's a lot more stuff than just dos attacks for security um such as SSL encryptions backups uh Version Control in case something goes wrong with your code you know you can just revert back right so you need all of this in place next is my favorite one which is customer support if they have a chat B on their site where you can communicate directly with them and ask them questions and get answers more importantly then I definitely suggest um you know going with them if not maybe it's time to look at someone else who can provide this kind of priority support next is realtime data so they give you real-time functionality which is basically Dynamic content on your website so typically speaking most hosting providers or shared hosting providers with limited features will essentially only give you static sites that means you can't have something that updates everything is going to be hard cached that means it's going to show old stale data all the time you do not want this okay uh and and that's why I mean I'm using NEX js15 uh in this project and the reason because NEX 15 will not cash any responses unless you ex explicitly say you know cash this response right unless you say it um it's not going to cash it but some hosting providers will cash all responses so you want to make sure that you're using the right front-end stack and at the same time your hosting provider gives you the ability to not only host static sites but literally puts a lot more time in into real-time functionality and advanced caching options where you can cache certain pages certain responses that are static and everything else that's Dynamic you can use Dynamic data so when should you consider looking into all of these in such great detail well I already mentioned first of all if you are a service provider or if you're building something for your client that needs high traffic high scalability and at the same time it grows 99.99% uptime all this kind of stuff if you're looking for something like this then you're definitely going to need to look into this another thing is if you are an Enterprise grade company right so if you are an Enterprise grade company and you have 50 to 500 or even 500 plus employees and you need a dashboard some sort of a system where your team members can do work for you and at the same time you know it just your infrastructure can handle all the traffic you're going to get especially if you have a sale right imagine you have an e-commerce store and you have a cyber monday sale you're going to get stormed right and so you should be able able to help um you know support this help uh your customers get a seamless experience and especially at the Enterprise level when you have so many customers sometimes even 26,000 visitors per hour right and if you have something like this you definitely definitely want to consider this now what are situations where you don't need to consider any of these options of course if you are just a student or something and you're just building maybe a portfolio for yourself to I don't know just have it there but if you ask me if your goal here is just to create a site to get five monthly visitors then you probably don't even need a website you can you can just use your Instagram profile I don't even need I don't even know why you want a website to yourself I mean even if you're trying to build something static it doesn't mean you don't need this it's just that if you're thinking in the long term in terms of growth in terms of hey I'm building a website because I want traffic right and so then you're going to need to go with the provider that gives you just enough so that you're not overpaying for any of the features that you're not going to use and you're using only the things that you're paying for now this brings me to my next Point your hosting provider needs to be coste efficient okay and more importantly they need to be transparent with everything so this is one big problem in this space which is there's a lot of hidden costs I hate this personally I really don't like this when you know hosting providers kind of hide all of this and so you need to make sure that your hosting Prov provider is publicly sharing all of the pricing page you know pricing page details and it's clear you know exactly how much you're going to be paying so you don't end up with a $7,000 monthly bill and finally you want to look at customer reviews did someone love the product so much that they left a review if they did I think that is a green flag okay look at what other people's experiences are by using these hosting providers and that way you can consider maybe giving it a shot now yes there are so many things that I just spoke about and there are so many options out there you might not even know which one to choose which one gives you exactly what we spoke about and so I did some research to first see what problems you guys face while building WordPress sites and based on the responses I got from the polls I went ahead and did some research and found a couple hosting providers that do a really good job and one of these hosting providers actually reached out to me saying they have something awesome for you guys and this company is called rapid Cloud they're also the sponsor of today's video so thank you so much rapid Cloud for making this possible for the web prodigies Community now rapid cloud is a high performance WordPress hosting provider that is built specifically for businesses with Dynamic and content Rich websites now like I mentioned they also promise every single thing that I just mentioned right here and they are mainly for high trffic sites so that means they are powered by Lightspeed Enterprise Technologies uh Advanced caching mechanisms and they're they're backed by AWS so you are pretty much going to get exceptional performance and so not only do they offer some cuttingedge technologies they also focus on the five things that we spoke about speed scalability Security Options awesome customer support and they're very transparent with all of their pricing so this is definitely something you have to look into all right guys so let's take a look at the awesome offer they have for the web prodigies community so you can go to their website and open up an account or you can use my link in the description to get a free trial this also gives me a little bit of a kickback so thank you so much for supporting me you can get a free account with my link only so please use the link in the description if you want to get access to the discount that I'm going to mention right now you will get 25% off on your annual plan okay this is a massive saving and you can just take a look at any other provider I'm sure for the value they offer it's so much better to go with rapid Cloud okay and so you get 25% off on the annual plan and if you wanted to use a monthly plan which I mean I wouldn't recommend I would say go for the annual plan because um we're we're in this for the long term right we're not going to open up a website for 10 days so it's probably going to be for lifetime so if you're starting a business you definitely want to save more and in the future you can always downgrade to a monthly plan if you'd like on the monthly plan you get 10% off on your monthly subscription okay so use a link in the description and grab your free account now most importantly do not forget to use this code at checkout to apply this discount okay so please use this code webp checkout in order to grab your 25% off your annual plan or 10% off your monthly plan once again thank you so much for using my link in the description and now let's move on to the next section I'm going to show you how to use Rapid cloud and uh just pretty much give you a demo of the tool so you can see exactly why they're so powerful all right so first up if you have any questions you can always sign in and ask them directly through the chapot here they will assist you and make sure you're all set the first cool feature is the migration feature you can migrate your current WordPress site into rapid Cloud by just contacting them through this button next is cron jobs you can set up activities and timed events under the cach tab you can access advanced level caching strategies for your WordPress site then comes the database you can also store data inside rapid Cloud you also have a bunch of Security Options like I mentioned you have a file manager to store all of your WordPress files file access control the server tab will show you all of the tools that are currently running on your WordPress site you can also access the live link of your website by clicking on the domain Tab and there you go this is the website that we currently have you can also check your backups so every 15 minutes your stuff will obviously be saved and you can access all of that in here you can check the stats you can check overview you can check traffic and you can also access all of the plugins directly from here this is another one of the problems that you guys mentioned and um rapid Cloud does an awesome job with helping out with this stuff all right guys now click the link in the description it's going to take you to the pricing page now this is where we can set up our account so the first thing you need to do is click on the annual plan because we want the most amount of savings and you're going to save additional 25% when you use my code at checkout right so make sure you click on the annual plan and um again you can also choose the two-year plan if you want but I would prefer this in my situation so I'm I'm going to go ahead and click on this one and now in terms of which plan you need here I would suggest going with the startup and this is actually what I require so I will select this one as well now there is one more called the Enterprise level plan now this is if uh like I mentioned you have a big team and you want even more you know um upgraded services like a light support uh you get free migration Services all that kind of stuff and so if you need some additional Services then maybe you might want to consider the Enterprise plan okay but for now I think in my given situation and probably most of you guys you're probably going to need the startup one plan so go ahead and click on start for free and that's going to take you to the uh the plan selection page and now I'm going to select the free trial because I want to first set up my account before I pay and uh even if you do choose to pay right away you have a 14-day money back guarantee and they will also give you support if you require any support to set up uh set up things for yourself okay okay so I'm going to select the free plan and then go ahead and add your credit card details in here and the most important one please do not forget this in order to get the discount you need to add the code webp and hit apply and then once you're done you can also verify here to see the 25% additional savings and you are saving close to $400 which is massive okay and so once you're done go ahead and click on start your free trial I've already created my account so let's go ahead and take a look at the dashboard all right so I've gone ahead and created my account and the first thing is you might be prompted to create a site and it'll also show you a popup if it does go ahead and proceed through uh I've already created my site but if you haven't you can click on the ad site right here and uh proceed with creating your website okay so once you're done with this go ahead and click into this and like I said you have a ton of important resources that you can access from here such as you know checking the traffic of your site uh the usage of your server you know more more in terms of woocommerce the plug-in management which is what you guys wanted and a lot more stuff inside here okay I'm sure you watched the demo uh but for now I'm going to go ahead and deploy the stuff and pretty much set up the same stuff that I have locally inside here okay so the first thing is click on your WordPress uh account right here and then you're going to find WordPress admin right so click on this WordPress admin and it's going to take you into your admin dashboard all right so there you go now we are inside our dashboard the first thing you're going to do is click on plugins add new plugin and you're going to look up woocommerce okay so just look this up real quick and that's going to show up in here you want to install that plug-in and click on activate now I've already done that so that's why it's showing active but make sure you download and install that now it will have a couple onboarding Pages please skip through that that whole process you're going to find a button called skip make sure you click on Skip and then that's essentially going to uh send you to another page which will ask you which location is your is your site hosted in and just put your location uh I'm just going to put United States and then I'm going to click on continue and then that's going to take me to uh to this page right here where I can see my woocommerce dashboard okay skip over this for now we don't need it now I would recommend if you have time in the future yes go in and do all this stuff but I want to show you how to uh upload all of our products right so next thing is you want to go into the products tab I'm sorry guys you want to go into settings tab click on Advanced click on rest API and now you're going to add a key so if you don't have a key I mean of course you're not going to have one because this is the production rapid uh the rapid Cloud link so go ahead and click on ADD key and then add the word products in here please don't make this error Okay add the word products and then click on generate API key and then once that's done if you click back on advance and rest API you should find that right here all right now once you're done with that the next stage is to upload all of our products into our new um rapid Cloud dashboard so what I'm going to do is I'm going to click on products and you're going to notice nothing is going to be in here for you right and so what we could do is import all of our products from our local environments now here's something you need to keep in mind all of these products I I mean I basically spent some time and just created a bunch of products in here and the thing to keep in mind here is these products are all in a in the local environment right so you can see it says not secure because it's a local testing WordPress environment and if you look at look at rapid Cloud you're getting a free SSL certificate as well right and so because of that you can't access you cannot access these images publicly right so if you send the link to someone else it it may not work and so how do you get these images well we're going to need to upload them inside the media folder and then we have to attach all of these uh products to the product itself okay so what you're going to do is go into your media files and click on add new media file and this is inside the rapid Cloud dashboard and then you're going to click on U select files and then you're going to go into the Discord and if you have already installed U downloaded the the assets folder you're going to find a folder for images only right so drag those images into this and then essentially upload that into the media library once that's done we're going to go into products and all we're going to do now is we need to import all of the products in here so go go back to our local dashboard we're going to click on export click on generate CSV and that's going to install uh download a file for us and so the next step is go back to our rapid Cloud dashboard in here we're going to click on import choose file and we're going to choose the new file that was uploaded so I'm just going to click on this one and then I'm going to click on continue and now this is important right because remember I mentioned that the IM are not going to be accessible uh because these are local right you see it says local so what you're going to need to do is click on do not import for the images and then go ahead and click on run the Importer and you might see an error and if you do that's fine okay looks like I didn't see any error uh I thought we're probably going to have some more because of this uh the file format but okay everything looks good then go ahead and click on view products it's going to take you in here but yes of course you don't have the images so what I'm going to do now is I'm just going to map some of the images that I've already added so I'm going to click on the product itself click on set product image and I'm just going to select some images from here and just attach them to the product and then click on update so go ahead and just take 2 minutes to add these products and then we'll proceed all right so now I have created all of the products because I've imported it from the other store and I've also mapped the images to it so like I said you can click on ADD product image and then select it from the uh from the media file and then click on update and now I did that for everything so I have my products ready to go but now we have to update our front end so remember we added a uh an API key right so I hope you copied and pasted that API key inside your code base if you haven't already um no worries you can delete this and you can add another one right so you can revoke this and add the same API key with the same word but I've already added my keys to my codebase so let's proceed from there once you're done with the API Keys the next thing you need is to visit the store and you want to copy this link right and you can visit the store visit the store by clicking on this drop- down right here and click on visit store and then I'm going to go into my actions product. typescript and I'm going to replace this with the new link okay so before this it was local now this is a production link and then everything else can stay as is just make sure you have the same description name products right here or else it's not going to work right so have the same description in here as well once you're done changing the website URL open up the terminal click on bun run I mean enter Bun Run Dev hit enter and then refresh the browser and make sure you are on Local Host 3000 once you're done you should see all of our products come in directly from our production rapid Cloud WordPress backend okay so great job you now know how to set up a production grade WordPress as a headless CMS for your front-end nextjs application and just just to verify that everything works you can click on products you can add them to the cart you can change the quantity as well right and let's make sure our state management works okay awesome State management works as well and I'm going to try to add some stuff in here let's try to increment awesome and then you can see the you know the price also changes as you increment right and now if you click on checkout it's going to take you to our stripe page awesome now another thing to keep in mind is you can use other things that woocommerce offers like payment uh payment forms or I mean they have their own woo payment structure right so you can use that if you'd like to kind of um automate the process use your components and I mean there's so much more you can do with this I'm sure you guys are very creative and uh I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys have to build and that's it that's all you need to do to set up WordPress as a headless CMS for your nextjs build now if you found this helpful and you want more helpful resources
